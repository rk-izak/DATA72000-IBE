      "Crizotinib has shown significant benefits in treating lung adenocarcinoma, particularly in patients with ALK-positive lung cancer. In phase-3 clinical trials, crizotinib demonstrated a higher response rate (65% vs. 20%) and improved progression-free survival (7.7 months vs. 3.0 months) compared to chemotherapy. Additionally, in another trial, crizotinib treatment resulted in a median progression-free survival of 10.9 months versus 7.0 months for chemotherapy, with an objective response rate of 75% compared to 45%. Improvements in quality of life were also reported for patients receiving crizotinib.
