      "- ID 1122: HERA was a Phase III trial assessing application of trastuzumab in an extended adjuvant setting.  Patients were HER2 positive with completely excised invasive BC, node positive or negative, and having undergone prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.  In the 3 arm study patients were given trastuzumab courses of 1 year, 2 years, or untreated.  At the first planned interim analysis, trastuzumab treatment for one year was compared with observation alone.  A significant difference in disease-free survival was seen with 220 DFS events out of 1693 in the observation arm versus 127 DFS events out of 1694 in the 1 year trastuzumab arm.  1 year adjuvant trastuzumab is currently the standard of care.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ERBB2 Amplification\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"HER2 amplification is a significant predictor of sensitivity to Trastuzumab, as evidenced by multiple clinical trials demonstrating improved outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancer patients receiving this therapy. The HERA trial showed a marked increase in disease-free survival for patients treated with adjuvant Trastuzumab compared to observation alone, while other studies highlighted enhanced overall survival and response rates when Trastuzumab was combined with chemotherapy. Furthermore, the molecular profile of ERBB2 amplification indicates a correlation with aggressive disease, reinforcing the importance of targeting this pathway for effective treatment.

CNS disease) were randomized to reiceive either Alectinib or Crizotinib. During a median follow-up of 17.6 months (crizotinib) and 18.6 months (alectinib), an event of disease progression/death occurred in 41% (62/152  pt) in the alectinib group and 68% (102/151 patients) in the crizotinib group. 12-month event-free survival rate 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib. A total of 18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an event of CNS progression, compared to 68 patients (45%) in the crizotinib group.

      "- ID 1200: This retrospective study of patients from the PROFILE 1001 and 1005 studies of crizotinib in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC assessed the potential benefit of crizotinib beyond progressive disease (CBPD), defined as continuation of crizotinib for 3 or more weeks after disease progression on crizotinib. 194 patients who had developed PD by data cutoff were studied, where 120 received crizotinib for a median duration of 19.4 weeks and 74 discontinued crizotinib after PD. No gross imbalances in clinicopathologic features of the two groups were evident.  Significantly longer overall survival was observed in the crizotinib continuing group from time of PD (16.4 vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17–0.42; P < 0.0001), and from the time of initial crizotinib (29.6 vs. 10.8 months; HR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19–0.46; P < 0.0001).\n",

Progression free survival was also significantly improved with crizotinib over chemotherapy in the tBM subgroup (9.0 vs. 4.0 months; HR 0.40; P<0.001), where in the intent to treat population it was 10.9 vs. 7.0 months (HR 0.45; P<0.001), indicating that the difficult to treat BM population obtained benefit from crizotinib at both the brain and systemic level.\n",

      "- ID 1691: In an evaluation of a patient with crizotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma, an EML4-ALK-E13;A20 rearrangement was identified using CGP.  The patient attained a reduction in the target lesions by 14.2%, however, the patient relapsed 17 months later.\n",
      "- ID 1187: In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.\n",
      "- ID 1207: In the PROFILE 1001 study of crizotinib in 82 patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, 31 patients with sufficient tumor material were tested using RT-PCR for the presence of certain EML4-ALK variants.  13/31 tested patients had the EML4-ALK variant 1. Of these, 12/13 had a partial response, and 1 had stable disease. This response rate of 92% is in contrast to the 57% response rate in the overall patient population, but the numbers of patients with specific EML4-ALK breakpoints were insufficient to correlate with patient response rate.\n",
      "- ID 1245: This case study presented a 53-year-old never-smoker with a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm. Morphology and immunohistochemistry were unable to establish the primary tumor site. Right upper extremity (RUE), scalp, and multiple lung lesions were apparent. A lung lesion sample with sufficient material for molecular profiling was not attainable but sufficient material was present from the RUE for hybrid capture genomic profiling  (FoundationOne kit was used). EML4-ALK variant 3 was found, and the patient was started on crizotinib. Rapid symptom improvement was seen. After 1 month, a CT scan showed significant size reduction in lung tumors, and after 5 months the patient was asymptomatic with an entirely negative examination.\n",
      "- ID 1189: In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.\n",
      "- ID 1196: EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) were expressed in Ba/F3 cells using retrovirus.  While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 1190: Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.\n",
      "- ID 1193: In a set of 31 patients with NSCLC, RT-PCR was performed to test for known EML4-ALK variants.  Five patients tested positive for the 3a/3b EML4-ALK variant.  Of these, 4 had partial response (PR), and one had disease progression (DP), and this was the only DP in the group of 31.  In contrast, of the 13 testing positive for EML4-ALK variant 1, 12 showed PR, and 1 showed stable disease.  These results potentially mirror findings in the H2228 3a/3b containing NSCLC cell line where some literature indicates it does respond as strongly to ALK inhibition as other EML4-ALK NSCLC cell lines.\n",
      "- ID 1356: In Ba/F3 cells, crizotinib sensitivty of the NPM-ALK variant was compared to crizotinib sensitivity of EML4-ALK variant 3. 50% of maximal inhibitory concentration for NPM-ALK was 42 nM, which was approximately 4x greater than IC50 of 11 nM obtained for EML4-ALK. The IC50 for parental Ba/F3 supplemented with IL3 was 2299 nM, resulting in a fold difference of 209.2 for EML4-ALK and 55.1 for NPM-ALK, indicating some reduced sensitivity for NPM-ALK in direct comparison to EML4-ALK, but substantial sensitization to crizotinib for NPM-ALK in Ba/F3 cells.\n",
      "- ID 1197: Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) showed differential sensitivity to both crizotinib and TAE684, with variant 3a (E6;A20) being the least sensitive. The authors suggest that the type/structure of ALK fusion may have some impact on patient outcome in targeted therapy.\n",
      "- ID 262: A 28 year-old patient with non-small cell lung cancer that failed conventional therapy was found to harbor the EML4-ALK (E13;A20) fusion using reverse transcription PCR. Treatment with 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulted in rapid improvement of symptoms and disease control for 5 months.\n",
      "- ID 1198: This two arm Phase III study named PROFILE 1007 (NCT00932893) was performed to assess crizotinib vs. established chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients positive for ALK rearrangement (assessed by break-apart FISH) with locally advanced or metastatic disease. 347 patients with disease progression after one round of platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive crizotinib (N=173) or chemotherapy (N=174) consisting of pemetrexed in pemetrexed-naive patients and docetaxel for patients previously treated with pemetrexed. The primary endpoint - progression free survival (PFS) - was found to be significantly better for patients treated with crizotinib (median 7.7 months) than with chemotherapy (median 3.0 months) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001). Response rates were 65% for crizotinib treatment and 20% for chemotherapy (P<0.001). Improvements in quality of life were also reported.\n",
      "- ID 1199: This phase 3 trial named PROFILE 1014 (NCT01154140) compared crizotinib to established chemotherapy in first-line treatment for this disease. The study consisted of 343 patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC that tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break-apart FISH assay, and had no prior systemic treatment. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to crizotinib (N=172) or pemetrexed with cisplatin or carboplatin (N=171). Progression free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (10.9 vs. 7.0 months; hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.60;P<0.001), and objective response rate was higher with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (75% vs. 45%, P<0.001). Improvement in quality of life was also reported.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

The above mutation was found in 1 kindred; 10 members were tested and 3 were found to harbour the mutation. The 7 members without a mutation were asymptomatic, while the 3 members with a mutation had manifestations. In addition to the 3 members who tested positive, there were 2 additional members who displayed manifestations, but died before testing could be performed. Clinical manifestations in this kindred included: renal cell carcinoma, CNS hemangioblastoma, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, and retinal hemangioblastoma.

ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib.

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

      "- ID 7496: In this phase 1 dose-escalation study seventy patients with metastatic solid tumours were enrolled. Eight patient tumours were found to harbour NTRK gene fusions, six of which were ETV6-NTRK3. Treatment with larotrectinib resulted in reduced tumour burden for all patients with NTRK fusions. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 7993: Case report of a 61-year-old man with B-ALL. An initial analysis detected the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion and a NRASGly12Asp mutation. Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).\n",
      "- ID 8930: Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis of a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk) revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 8917: All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",
      "- ID 8931: The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 6099: Four out of six patients with infantile fibrosarcoma and a ETV6-NTRK3 fusion had a partial response, the remaining two had a complete response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",

VHL mutations were detected in affected family members, but not in unaffected family members or 96 normal individuals, however it seems unaffected family members were not tested genetically for the mutations. Mutations in the VHL gene were detected by SSCP and DNA sequencing. Haplotypes were determined with four microsatellite polymorphic probes. The missense mutation L184P (c.551T>C) (In the paper noted as nucleotide position 764 and codon position 255 due to old reference transcript), was found in 2 individuals in family 3708. Both individuals were identified with renal cell carcinoma and one also presented with a CNS hemangioblastoma. Additional information regarding the family information, including a pedigree, were not provided.

Patient 1 presented with retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH) in her left eye at age the age of 13, which was treated with radiation. At age 62 years, this eye had good visual acuity (20/20) without any RCHs. As of her last visit, patient 1 also presented with abnormalities in the CNS, pancreas and kidney. She was found to have the L184P (c.551T>C) mutation. Her last known age was 69 years old.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RT-PCR, and sequencing of the product confirmed a SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene (SNX2 exon 3 fused in frame to ABL1 exon 4) was present. The patient also was found to carry an IKZF1 deletion (exons 2-8) and amplification of PAX5. The patient was treated with vindesine, idarubicin, and dexamethasone (VDP) and VDCP (plus cyclophosphamide) regimens. He received two bone marrow transplants, but eventually died of disease. The patient did not receive tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.\n",

The SNX2-ABL1 fusion, which joins the N-terminal domain of SNX2 without the PX domain to ABL1 exon 4, was detected by RACE PCR and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The patient responded to initial chemotherapy, but relapsed early. He then demonstrated a response to hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-C-VAD), but relapsed again.

The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is rare; in this study investigating 373 high risk pediatric B-ALL patients of which 29 demonstrated uncommon kinase gene fusions, only one case with SNX2-ABL1 (exon 3-exon 4) was observed. Gene expression profiles were compared to Ph-positive B-ALL and reportedly all fusion-containing samples (except P2RY8-CRLF2) were similar to BCR-ABL1-positive patients. This patient did not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered in combination with chemotherapy at the first or second relapses.\n",

Karyotype analysis showed a t(5;9)(q22;q34), resulting in a SNX2-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated based on the ALL-BFM95 regimen; although he received remission, he relapsed during maintenance, 15 months after the initial diagnosis. He could not achieve the second remission using chemotherapy, but was treated at this time with imatinib (dose of 240 mg/m2 /d once daily); this allowed to achieve disease control and proceed with an umbilical cord blood transplant. However, at 6 months from transplantation, the patient developed bone marrow relapse again. He never achieved a remission after the second relapse (despite salvage chemotherapies and therapy with both imatinib and dasatinib). The patient died of progressive disease.\n",

Gene expression analysis showed enrichment for BCR-ABL1+ ALL using GSEA. After first relapse (15 months after diagnosis) the patient was given imatinib at a dose of 240 mg/m2/d once daily and his disease stabilized for 2 months. The patient received dasatinib (80 mg/m2/d once daily) after an umbilical cord blood transplant and did not respond to treatment.

      "Additional Information:\n",
      "- Molecular Profile: ABL1 SNX2::ABL1\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",

Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",

Using a thymidine incorporation assay, S249C expressing cells were shown to lose contact inhibition and grew 3x to 4x more rapidly than controls. Soft agar assays demonstrated increased colony formation and anchorage independent growth in S249C expressing cells versus controls. All nude mice subcutaneously injected with S249C cells rapidly formed tumors, but no tumors were observed in empty vector injected mice. The authors conclude mutated FGFR3b-S249C has transforming properties attributed to oncogenes.\n",

Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",

Metastatic lesions were found in the lung and spine. Pan-TRK immunostain was positive and RNA NGS detected a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion.

The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.\n",

Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline.

Because the typical ETV6::NTRK3 fusion was not found, more extensive molecular profiling was done. A t(2;15)(p21;q24) translocation was identified by cytogenetics and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed clear copy-number transitions within EML4 and NTRK3. An EML4::NTRK3 (e2::e14) fusion was confirmed by RNA sequencing. This fusion was in-frame with breakpoints at exon 2 of EML4 and exon 14 of NTRK3. Stable lentiviral transduction of this fusion into NIH-3T3 cells induced soft agar colony growth in vitro and tumors in vivo. Based on similar positive cellular transformation and functional motifs to the typically found ETV6::NTRK3, the authors conclude other fusion partners like EML4::NTRK3 can contribute to the development of congenital fibrosarcoma.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ERBB2 Amplification\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\n",

      "The evidence from the clinical trials supports the claim that HER2 amplification predicts sensitivity to Trastuzumab through improved clinical outcomes in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. In Evidence ID 528, patients receiving Trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy showed improved time to disease progression, objective response rate, and duration of response compared to chemotherapy alone. Similarly, Evidence ID 529 demonstrated that Trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy (docetaxel) led to improved overall survival, response rate, response duration, time to progression, and time to treatment failure. Evidence ID 1122 from the HERA trial showed a significant improvement in disease-free survival for patients receiving one year of adjuvant Trastuzumab compared to observation alone.

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

      "The evidence from the phase-3 clinical trials supports the claim that ALK-positive lung adenocarcinoma is sensitive to crizotinib by demonstrating significantly higher response rates and longer progression-free survival (PFS) for patients treated with crizotinib compared to those receiving chemotherapy. In the trials, crizotinib treatment resulted in response rates of 65% and 75%, compared to 20% and 45% for chemotherapy, indicating a markedly better tumor response to crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib significantly extended PFS, with median durations of 7.7 and 10.9 months, compared to 3.0 and 7.0 months for chemotherapy, respectively.

A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

Clinically, primary cultures from AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed a cytotoxic response to the drug, and patient plasma inhibited FLT3 phosphorylation in Molm14 cells, further supporting its efficacy. However, limitations include the small sample size of patient-derived cultures and potential variability in patient responses, which may not fully represent the broader AML population. Additionally, in vitro results may not always translate directly to clinical outcomes due to differences in the complexity of living organisms.\n",

This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.\n",

      "The BRAF V600E mutation is indeed a significant target for therapies such as vemurafenib and cobimetinib, which are designed to inhibit the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway activated by this mutation. In the studies provided, patients with the BRAF V600E mutation showed improved outcomes when treated with the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib compared to vemurafenib alone. For instance, in a Phase 1b study, patients who had never received a BRAF inhibitor had an 87% objective response rate and a median progression-free survival of 13.7 months. In a Phase III trial, the combination therapy resulted in a median progression-free survival of 12.3 months compared to 7.2 months with vemurafenib and placebo. These results highlight the enhanced effectiveness of targeting the BRAF V600E mutation with combination therapies.\n",

The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma.

In the study, this mutation was identified in patients with VHL disease but was absent in 96 control cases, indicating that it is not a common variant in the general population. This absence in controls supports the notion that the mutation is not a benign polymorphism but rather a pathogenic variant associated with the disease. The increased prevalence of the mutation in affected individuals compared to controls provides strong evidence of its pathogenicity, as per ACMG code PS4. This rarity in the general population, combined with its presence in affected individuals, strengthens the argument that the mutation is causative for VHL disease.\n",

Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.\n",

      "The varying clinical manifestations of VHL disease among patients with the F76del variant, as described in the evidence, highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease, which can affect the coherence of the evidence supporting the claim. The presence of mutations in patients with both classic multi-organ and limited single-organ manifestations suggests that the F76del variant may not have a uniform phenotypic expression. This variability can complicate the interpretation of the variant's pathogenicity and its role in VHL disease. The recommendation for follow-up in families with limited manifestations indicates a need for further investigation to understand the full spectrum of clinical outcomes associated with this variant. Overall, the evidence suggests that while the F76del variant is associated with VHL disease, its clinical impact may vary significantly among individuals.\n",

Of 69 patients with measurable disease, 35 achieved objective response, with median duration of response 13.5 months. Of 16 patients with measurable CNS disease, four achieved CNS complete response and 8 showed CNS partial response. median duration of CNS response was 11.1 months. 2 deaths were observed, and 1 was judged related to study treatment.\n",
      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",
      "- ID 8657: A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib.

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than with crizotinib (HR for disease progression or death 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.65, p<0.001). Investigator-assessed RR was 82.9% in alectinib arm and 75.5% in crizotinib arm. CNS RR in patients with measurable CNS lesions was 81% and 50% for alectinib and crizotinib, respectively. Eight patients in the alectinib group, in comparison to one patient with crizotinib, had a complete CNS response. Despite longer treatment duration for alectinib, there were fewer grade 3-5 adverse events compared with crizotinib treatment.\n",
      "- ID 1273: In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.\n",

ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease.

IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib. Additionally, plasma taken from 3 patients receiving 120mg of gilteritinib daily was able to inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation in Molm14 cells.\n",
      "- ID 8924: In vitro gilteritinib treatment of MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells, which endogenously express FLT3-ITD, showed growth suppression based on CellTiter GLO cytotoxicity assays with IC50 values of 0.92 nM (95% CI: 0.23–3.6 nM) and 2.9 nM (95% CI: 1.4–5.8 nM), respectively. Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15. Gilteritinib treated mice showed significantly less widespread disease at day 42 than control counterparts (N=10, p<0.001) and significantly improved survival (log-rank, p<0.001).\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: FLT3 ITD\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.\n",

      "- ID 8106: Gilteritinib inhibited the cell growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y (IC50 1.6 nM; 95% CI: 1.1–2.4 nM) compared to controls (IC50 420nM; 95% CI: 350–500 nM). Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop. This inhibitory mechanism allows for kinase inhibition to occur in the face of D835 mutation.\n",

Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations.

      "In Evidence ID 6099, variability in response to larotrectinib among patients with ETV6-NTRK3 fusions is observed. Specifically, out of six patients with infantile fibrosarcoma and the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion, four experienced a partial response, while the remaining two achieved a complete response. This indicates that while all patients with this specific fusion responded to the treatment, the degree of response varied between partial and complete.

      "- ID 5055: 93 families that fulfilled the clinical criteria of VHL disease were assessed for germline mutations in the VHL gene, and mutations were found in all affected family members. The c.551T>C (p.L184P) mutation was found in a family (Lineage 14) in which members were clinically diagnosed with VHL presenting without pheochromocytoma (VHL type 1), however, no further phenotypic information about specific patients was provided. This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript (AF010238.1). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot. Relevant ACMG codes include: PP4, because the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 5264: Screening of 92 unrelated patients with VHL disease revealed 61 DNA variants. No variants were found in 96 control cases. This missense mutation was found in a VHL type 1 patient and two VHL type 2B patients (patient no. V322, V36, V262). This study contains strong evidence of pathogenicity for this variant because the prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence In controls (ACMG code: PS4). No additional family members were screened in all 3 cases.\n",
      "- ID 5744: Genotype-phenotype correlations of 573 VHL patients were analyzed and confirmed that higher risk of pheochromocytoma is associated with missense mutations that result in substitution of a surface amino acid or that disrupt the structural integrity of the VHL gene product (pVHL). Age-related risks of retinal angiomas and renal cell carcinoma were higher in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations. This mutation was found in 4 unrelated families of 8 individuals total. 5 individuals had retinal hemangioblastomas, 4 had hemangioblastomas of the cerebellum, and 3 had renal cell carcinoma. ACMG evidence codes: 'PM4' because they observe a protein length change as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region or stop-loss variants, 'PP4' because the patients' phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 4943: In a study of 114 unrelated VHL affected families, germline mutations in the VHL gene were identified in 85 of the families. VHL mutations were detected in affected family members, but not in unaffected family members or 96 normal individuals, however it seems unaffected family members were not tested genetically for the mutations. Mutations in the VHL gene were detected by SSCP and DNA sequencing. Haplotypes were determined with four microsatellite polymorphic probes. The missense mutation L184P (c.551T>C) (In the paper noted as nucleotide position 764 and codon position 255 due to old reference transcript), was found in 2 individuals in family 3708. Both individuals were identified with renal cell carcinoma and one also presented with a CNS hemangioblastoma. Additional information regarding the family information, including a pedigree, were not provided. ACMG evidence codes: 'flag for PP4' since the patients phenotype and family history is consistent with VHL, 'flag for PP1' because there is co-segregation of variant with the phenotype in two members of the family.\n",

Patient 1 presented with retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH) in her left eye at age the age of 13, which was treated with radiation. At age 62 years, this eye had good visual acuity (20/20) without any RCHs. As of her last visit, patient 1 also presented with abnormalities in the CNS, pancreas and kidney. She was found to have the L184P (c.551T>C) mutation. Her last known age was 69 years old.

An association of clear cell renal carcinoma development with a relatively high loss of structural stability in VHL protein missense mutations was discovered, although this only reached significance when combining data from other studies (p=0.101 for present study; p=0.0086 for present study + other study data). This missense variant was found in a patient with spinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, retinal hemangioblastomas, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, and cysts of the broad ligament (patient no. F43).

      "- Molecular Profile: ABL1 SNX2::ABL1\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

      "The specific role of SNX2-ABL1 fusions in driving the disease's pathogenesis is not fully understood, but it is suggested to be significant due to its involvement in kinase signaling pathways. In the context of B-ALL, kinase fusions like SNX2-ABL1 are associated with Ph-like expression signatures, which are linked to poor prognosis and resistance to standard treatments. The SNX2-ABL1 fusion retains the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain, which may contribute to aberrant signaling pathways that promote leukemogenesis. Despite its rarity, the presence of SNX2-ABL1 in patients who do not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors suggests it plays a role in disease progression and resistance mechanisms.

      "- ID 7241: A 7-yr-old boy with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia was found to harbor the SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene. Gene expression analysis showed enrichment for BCR-ABL1+ ALL using GSEA. After first relapse (15 months after diagnosis) the patient was given imatinib at a dose of 240 mg/m2/d once daily and his disease stabilized for 2 months. The patient received dasatinib (80 mg/m2/d once daily) after an umbilical cord blood transplant and did not respond to treatment. Patient was put back on imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/m2/d once daily which rapidly decreased the number of blast cells. However, 6 months after transplant he had bone marrow relapse and did not again achieve remission by the time of reporting.\n",
      "- ID 9178: In the study involving 1725 B-ALL patients, 264 were identified by microarray-based algorithm to have a Ph-like expression signature. Next generation sequencing (RNAseq, WGS, and/or WES) performed on 154 Ph-like patients revealed 91% possessed genomic alterations activating kinase signaling with 96 (62%) involving rearrangements. In one adolescent male, an in-frame SNX2-ABL1 fusion (exon 3 and exon 4) with the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain intact was identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger. This patient, evaluated by WES and RNA-seq, also harbored IKZF1, EBF1, and VPREB deletions, and was designated Ph-like non CRLF2.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ABL1 SNX2::ABL1\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

      "The second case highlights that while Larotrectinib effectively targets KANK1::NTRK2 fusions, leading to an initial robust clinical response, the durability of this response is questionable. After 106 days of treatment, disease progression was observed, and molecular analysis showed that the KANK1::NTRK2 fusion was no longer detectable. This suggests that other genetic factors, such as the emergence of a minor subclone, may contribute to the progression and complicate long-term outcomes. The case underscores the potential for genetic evolution within tumors, which can lead to resistance to targeted therapies like Larotrectinib.

First, while larotrectinib can effectively target NTRK3 rearrangements, it does not address other potential mutations or issues, such as the NRAS mutation seen in the initial case, which may re-emerge or evolve. Second, the treatment may lead to insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis, as seen in the case where the patient succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis due to this issue.

      "The FGFR3 S249C mutation contributes to oncogenicity through several mechanisms. It leads to ligand-independent phosphorylation of FGFR3, resulting in the loss of contact inhibition and increased cell proliferation, as evidenced by the thymidine incorporation assay. The mutation also enhances anchorage-independent growth and colony formation, as shown in soft agar assays and xenograft models. Additionally, the S249C mutation increases dimer stability and alters dimer structure, although it does not induce constitutive dimerization.

      "The bladder cancer cell line 97-7, which expresses the FGFR3 S249C mutation, shows resistance to cisplatin, as indicated by a higher IC50 value (44.6 µg/ml) compared to FGFR3 wild-type cell lines 5637 and T24. This resistance is associated with increased Akt signaling, as evidenced by a higher phosphorylated-Akt/total Akt ratio in 97-7 cells. The oncogenic properties of FGFR3 S249C likely contribute to this resistance by activating the Akt pathway, promoting cell survival and reducing cisplatin efficacy. Therapeutically, targeting the Akt signaling pathway with inhibitors like GDC0068 or LY294002 can sensitize 97-7 cells to cisplatin, suggesting that combining cisplatin with Akt inhibitors could be an effective strategy for treating cancers with FGFR3 S249C mutations.

Dimer stability was modestly increased by S249C (-3.7 kcal/mol) versus wildtype FGFR3 (-3.4 kcal/mol). Intrinsic FRET demonstrated S249C dimers were significantly closer together (45 A) than the wildtype dimer (53 A). The substitution of cysteine was expected to lead to strong covalent bonds, but the authors conclude their data demonstrates S249C does not induce constitutive FGFR3 dimerization, but induces dimer structural modifications.\n",

Using a thymidine incorporation assay, S249C expressing cells were shown to lose contact inhibition and grew 3x to 4x more rapidly than controls. Soft agar assays demonstrated increased colony formation and anchorage independent growth in S249C expressing cells versus controls. All nude mice subcutaneously injected with S249C cells rapidly formed tumors, but no tumors were observed in empty vector injected mice. The authors conclude mutated FGFR3b-S249C has transforming properties attributed to oncogenes.\n",

      "The coherence of the evidence from both studies supports the claim that larotrectinib is effective for ETV6::NTRK3-positive infantile fibrosarcoma. In Evidence ID 6099, four out of six patients with this fusion had a partial response, and two had a complete response, indicating a high rate of effectiveness. Evidence ID 6473 further supports this by reporting a rapid, radiographic response in a patient with refractory infantile fibrosarcoma harboring the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Both studies consistently show positive outcomes for patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers, particularly those with ETV6::NTRK3 fusions. There are no inconsistencies in the data presented that challenge the conclusion about larotrectinib's effectiveness for this specific genetic profile.\n",

Evidence ID 6099 reports that four out of six patients with ETV6-NTRK3 fusion had a partial response, and two had a complete response to larotrectinib, indicating its effectiveness. Evidence ID 6473 supports this by describing a rapid, radiographic response in a patient with refractory infantile fibrosarcoma harboring the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Both pieces of evidence consistently show positive outcomes for patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers, particularly those with ETV6::NTRK3 fusions, aligning with the AI's conclusion about larotrectinib's effectiveness for this genetic profile.\n",
      "Answer quality check: yes\n",
      "Reasoning: The answer fully addresses the question by clearly explaining how the coherence of evidence from both studies supports the claim about larotrectinib's effectiveness. It provides specific data from the studies, such as the partial and complete response rates, and mentions the rapid response in a refractory case, which collectively demonstrate the drug's effectiveness. Additionally, the answer explicitly states that there are no inconsistencies in the data that could challenge the conclusion, thus covering both aspects of the question comprehensively and clearly.\n",

      "- ID 7496: In this phase 1 dose-escalation study seventy patients with metastatic solid tumours were enrolled. Eight patient tumours were found to harbour NTRK gene fusions, six of which were ETV6-NTRK3. Treatment with larotrectinib resulted in reduced tumour burden for all patients with NTRK fusions. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 6568: This was a Phase 1/2 study of 55 patients from 4 months to 76 years old with TRK-fusion positive tumors given NTRK inhibitor Larotrectinib. Patients had 17 unique NTRK fusion types. Patient overall response rate was 75% according to independent review and 80% according to investigator assessment. Authors state that Larotrectinib had durable anti tumor activity regardless of age or tumor type. 26/27 patients with NTRK3-fusion showed maximum percent change in tumor size between -30% and -100%.\n",

Patient overall response rate was 75% according to independent review and 80% according to investigator assessment. Authors state that Larotrectinib had durable anti tumor activity regardless of age or tumor type. 17/23 patients with NTRK1-fusion showed maximum percent change in tumor size between -30% and -100%.\n",
      "- ID 6100: One Patient with soft tissue sarcoma and a NTRK1-LMNA fusion had a partial response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",
      "- ID 6473: Nagasubramanian et al reports on a case of refractory infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) with constitutive activation of the tropomyosin‐related kinase (TRK) signaling pathway from an ETS variant gene 6–neurotrophin 3 receptor gene (ETV6–NTRK3) gene fusion. The patient was diagnosed with IFS at 6 months of age. At 16 months the patient enrolled in a pediatric Phase 1 trial of LOXO‐101 (Larotrectinib, ARRY-470), an experimental, highly selective inhibitor of TRK. The patient experienced a rapid, radiographic response, demonstrating the potential for LOXO‐101 to provide benefit for IFS harboring NTRK gene fusions.\n",

      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",
      "- ID 10362: In a further investigation of non-traditional sarcoma cases, a 41-year-old man was thought to have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in the neck and spinal cord, but large rhabdoid/epithelioid cell morphology and retained H3K27Me3. Metastatic lesions were found in the lung and spine. Pan-TRK immunostain was positive and RNA NGS detected a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion. The authors state this is the first report of a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion in a sarcoma, which seems to forecast high-grade morphology and behavior.\n",
      "- ID 8653: A case report showing a two-year-old girl with an unusual pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) with both classic- and anaplastic- appearing tumors. A custom NGS panel identified a novel KANK1-NTRK2 fusion in both the classic and anaplastic regions. The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.\n",
      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",

Initially, the presence of the KANK1::NTRK2 fusion was associated with the patient's tumor, and treatment with Larotrectinib, a TRK inhibitor, led to a significant reduction in tumor size and slight motor improvements, indicating that the fusion was a driver of the tumor's growth. The robust clinical response to Larotrectinib suggests that the KANK1::NTRK2 fusion was effectively targeted, leading to a temporary halt in tumor progression. However, the eventual disease progression, despite the absence of the KANK1::NTRK2 fusion in the rebiopsy, indicates that other genetic alterations, such as PDGFRA amplification, took over as the primary drivers of the tumor.

      "The presence of ETV6::NTRK3 fusions in various tumor types suggests that NTRK3 fusions, in general, play a significant role in tumorigenesis across different cancers. The identification of the EML4::NTRK3 fusion in infantile fibrosarcoma, which shares similar cellular transformation capabilities and functional motifs with ETV6::NTRK3, supports the idea that alternative fusion partners can also drive tumor development. This coherence in evidence indicates that while ETV6::NTRK3 is a well-known driver in certain cancers, EML4::NTRK3 can similarly contribute to oncogenesis in infantile fibrosarcoma. The findings imply that screening for various NTRK3 fusions, not just ETV6::NTRK3, could be important for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning in cancers where these fusions are relevant. Overall, the evidence supports the role of EML4::NTRK3 as a potential oncogenic driver in infantile fibrosarcoma, expanding the understanding of NTRK3 fusion diversity in cancer.\n",

The patient had a history of hemimelia in the same limb as the congenital fibrosarcoma, but no known family history and no known prenatal exposures. Because the typical ETV6::NTRK3 fusion was not found, more extensive molecular profiling was done. A t(2;15)(p21;q24) translocation was identified by cytogenetics and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed clear copy-number transitions within EML4 and NTRK3. An EML4::NTRK3 (e2::e14) fusion was confirmed by RNA sequencing. This fusion was in-frame with breakpoints at exon 2 of EML4 and exon 14 of NTRK3. Stable lentiviral transduction of this fusion into NIH-3T3 cells induced soft agar colony growth in vitro and tumors in vivo. Based on similar positive cellular transformation and functional motifs to the typically found ETV6::NTRK3, the authors conclude other fusion partners like EML4::NTRK3 can contribute to the development of congenital fibrosarcoma.\n",

      "The absence of the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion in control spindle cell tumors enhances the coherence of the evidence by demonstrating the specificity of this genetic marker for congenital fibrosarcoma. In both studies, the fusion was detected in a high percentage of congenital fibrosarcoma cases (70% and 91%) but was absent in a wide range of other spindle cell tumors, both malignant and benign. This clear distinction supports the claim that the presence of the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion is a reliable diagnostic criterion, as it is not found in other similar tumors. The specificity of the fusion to congenital fibrosarcoma reduces the likelihood of false positives, making it a desirable diagnostic tool. This specificity strengthens the argument for using ETV6::NTRK3 fusion detection in clinical settings to accurately diagnose congenital fibrosarcoma.\n",

Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",

RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations.

      "- ID 1122: HERA was a Phase III trial assessing application of trastuzumab in an extended adjuvant setting.  Patients were HER2 positive with completely excised invasive BC, node positive or negative, and having undergone prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.  In the 3 arm study patients were given trastuzumab courses of 1 year, 2 years, or untreated.  At the first planned interim analysis, trastuzumab treatment for one year was compared with observation alone.  A significant difference in disease-free survival was seen with 220 DFS events out of 1693 in the observation arm versus 127 DFS events out of 1694 in the 1 year trastuzumab arm.  1 year adjuvant trastuzumab is currently the standard of care.\n",
      "- ID 529: A randomized clinical trial of 186 patients with previously untreated, HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer demonstrated improved overall survival, response rate, response duration, time to progression, and time to treatment failure for patients who received trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy (docetaxel) compared to chemotherapy alone.\n",
      "- ID 528: A randomized clinical trial of 469 patients with previously untreated, HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer demonstrated improved time to disease progression, objective response rate, and duration of response for patients who received trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone.\n",
      "- ID 11774: Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2), resulting in partial duplication of the transcription factor MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint between exons 10 and 11 of MYB on 6q23.3 was identified in two of four angiocentric gliomas (AGs). This study did not mention the partner genes involved in the MYB rearrangements in the two AGs. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ERBB2 Amplification\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The claim that HER2 amplification predicts sensitivity to Trastuzumab is supported by substantial clinical evidence, particularly from trials such as HERA and others involving HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. These studies demonstrate that patients with HER2-positive tumors experience significant improvements in disease-free survival and overall survival when treated with Trastuzumab in conjunction with chemotherapy. However, while HER2 amplification is a strong predictor of response, it is important to note that some patients may still progress on Trastuzumab, indicating that additional factors may influence treatment outcomes. Overall, the evidence aligns well with the claim, reinforcing the role of HER2 amplification as a critical biomarker in guiding Trastuzumab therapy.\"\n",

      "- ID 4858: In a randomized, open-label phase 3 trial 303 patients with ALK-positive, previously untreated NSCLC (including asympt. CNS disease) were randomized to reiceive either Alectinib or Crizotinib. During a median follow-up of 17.6 months (crizotinib) and 18.6 months (alectinib), an event of disease progression/death occurred in 41% (62/152  pt) in the alectinib group and 68% (102/151 patients) in the crizotinib group. 12-month event-free survival rate 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib. A total of 18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an event of CNS progression, compared to 68 patients (45%) in the crizotinib group. Response rates were 82.9% (Alectinib) and 75.5% (crizotinib).\n",
      "- ID 1200: This retrospective study of patients from the PROFILE 1001 and 1005 studies of crizotinib in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC assessed the potential benefit of crizotinib beyond progressive disease (CBPD), defined as continuation of crizotinib for 3 or more weeks after disease progression on crizotinib. 194 patients who had developed PD by data cutoff were studied, where 120 received crizotinib for a median duration of 19.4 weeks and 74 discontinued crizotinib after PD. No gross imbalances in clinicopathologic features of the two groups were evident.  Significantly longer overall survival was observed in the crizotinib continuing group from time of PD (16.4 vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17–0.42; P < 0.0001), and from the time of initial crizotinib (29.6 vs. 10.8 months; HR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19–0.46; P < 0.0001).\n",
      "- ID 1201: This prospective Phase III study named Profile 1014 on NSCLC ALK-rearranged patients assessed intracranial disease control rate (IC-DCR) in the subset of patients entering the study with preexisting treated brain metastasis (tBM). IC-DCR was significantly improved in the tBM group given crizotinib (N=39) over chemotherapy (pemetrexed + cisplatin or carboplatin; N=40) at 12 weeks (85% vs. 45%, P<0.001), and at 24 weeks (56% vs. 25%, P=0.006). Progression free survival was also significantly improved with crizotinib over chemotherapy in the tBM subgroup (9.0 vs. 4.0 months; HR 0.40; P<0.001), where in the intent to treat population it was 10.9 vs. 7.0 months (HR 0.45; P<0.001), indicating that the difficult to treat BM population obtained benefit from crizotinib at both the brain and systemic level.\n",
      "- ID 1419: In a retrospective study comparing survival outcomes in a subgroup of 82 ALK-positive crizotinib-treated patients enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT00585195), crizotinib therapy was associated with improved survival. For the crizotinib-treated, ALK-positive patient group, 1 year survival was 74% and 2 year overall survival was 54%, compared with 72% and 36% for the control group (ALK-positive crizotinib naive patients).\n",
      "- ID 1577: A phase-3 clinical trial evaluated 347 patients with ALK-positive lung cancer.  The study compared crizotinib treatment (n=173) with chemotherapy treatment of either pemetrexed or docetaxel (n=174).  In the crizotinib arm, the response rate was significantly higher (65% vs 20%; P<0.001), the progression-free survival was increased (7.7 months vs. 3.0 months; HR=0.49, 95%CI:14 months-26 months; p<0.001), however, there was no significant improvement in overall survival (HR=1.02; 95%CI:0.68-1.54; P=0.54).  Of the patients on crizotinib treatment, global quality of life was improved relative to baseline when compared to chemotherapy patients (+5 mean change, -5 mean change; P<0.001).\n",
      "- ID 1691: In an evaluation of a patient with crizotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma, an EML4-ALK-E13;A20 rearrangement was identified using CGP.  The patient attained a reduction in the target lesions by 14.2%, however, the patient relapsed 17 months later.\n",
      "- ID 1187: In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.\n",
      "- ID 1207: In the PROFILE 1001 study of crizotinib in 82 patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, 31 patients with sufficient tumor material were tested using RT-PCR for the presence of certain EML4-ALK variants.  13/31 tested patients had the EML4-ALK variant 1. Of these, 12/13 had a partial response, and 1 had stable disease. This response rate of 92% is in contrast to the 57% response rate in the overall patient population, but the numbers of patients with specific EML4-ALK breakpoints were insufficient to correlate with patient response rate.\n",
      "- ID 1245: This case study presented a 53-year-old never-smoker with a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm. Morphology and immunohistochemistry were unable to establish the primary tumor site. Right upper extremity (RUE), scalp, and multiple lung lesions were apparent. A lung lesion sample with sufficient material for molecular profiling was not attainable but sufficient material was present from the RUE for hybrid capture genomic profiling  (FoundationOne kit was used). EML4-ALK variant 3 was found, and the patient was started on crizotinib. Rapid symptom improvement was seen. After 1 month, a CT scan showed significant size reduction in lung tumors, and after 5 months the patient was asymptomatic with an entirely negative examination.\n",
      "- ID 1189: In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.\n",
      "- ID 1196: EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) were expressed in Ba/F3 cells using retrovirus.  While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 1190: Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.\n",
      "- ID 1193: In a set of 31 patients with NSCLC, RT-PCR was performed to test for known EML4-ALK variants.  Five patients tested positive for the 3a/3b EML4-ALK variant.  Of these, 4 had partial response (PR), and one had disease progression (DP), and this was the only DP in the group of 31.  In contrast, of the 13 testing positive for EML4-ALK variant 1, 12 showed PR, and 1 showed stable disease.  These results potentially mirror findings in the H2228 3a/3b containing NSCLC cell line where some literature indicates it does respond as strongly to ALK inhibition as other EML4-ALK NSCLC cell lines.\n",
      "- ID 1356: In Ba/F3 cells, crizotinib sensitivty of the NPM-ALK variant was compared to crizotinib sensitivity of EML4-ALK variant 3. 50% of maximal inhibitory concentration for NPM-ALK was 42 nM, which was approximately 4x greater than IC50 of 11 nM obtained for EML4-ALK. The IC50 for parental Ba/F3 supplemented with IL3 was 2299 nM, resulting in a fold difference of 209.2 for EML4-ALK and 55.1 for NPM-ALK, indicating some reduced sensitivity for NPM-ALK in direct comparison to EML4-ALK, but substantial sensitization to crizotinib for NPM-ALK in Ba/F3 cells.\n",
      "- ID 1197: Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) showed differential sensitivity to both crizotinib and TAE684, with variant 3a (E6;A20) being the least sensitive. The authors suggest that the type/structure of ALK fusion may have some impact on patient outcome in targeted therapy.\n",
      "- ID 262: A 28 year-old patient with non-small cell lung cancer that failed conventional therapy was found to harbor the EML4-ALK (E13;A20) fusion using reverse transcription PCR. Treatment with 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulted in rapid improvement of symptoms and disease control for 5 months.\n",
      "- ID 1198: This two arm Phase III study named PROFILE 1007 (NCT00932893) was performed to assess crizotinib vs. established chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients positive for ALK rearrangement (assessed by break-apart FISH) with locally advanced or metastatic disease. 347 patients with disease progression after one round of platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive crizotinib (N=173) or chemotherapy (N=174) consisting of pemetrexed in pemetrexed-naive patients and docetaxel for patients previously treated with pemetrexed. The primary endpoint - progression free survival (PFS) - was found to be significantly better for patients treated with crizotinib (median 7.7 months) than with chemotherapy (median 3.0 months) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001). Response rates were 65% for crizotinib treatment and 20% for chemotherapy (P<0.001). Improvements in quality of life were also reported.\n",
      "- ID 1199: This phase 3 trial named PROFILE 1014 (NCT01154140) compared crizotinib to established chemotherapy in first-line treatment for this disease. The study consisted of 343 patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC that tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break-apart FISH assay, and had no prior systemic treatment. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to crizotinib (N=172) or pemetrexed with cisplatin or carboplatin (N=171). Progression free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (10.9 vs. 7.0 months; hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.60;P<0.001), and objective response rate was higher with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (75% vs. 45%, P<0.001). Improvement in quality of life was also reported.\n",
      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",
      "- ID 5097: Molecular analysis of VHL gene in 146 probands, 103 with and 43 without a positive family history, resulted in the detection of 43 germline VHL mutations. Majority of mutations were found in patients with classic or multi-organ manifestations of VHL disease, but mutations were also found in patients with limited or single-organ manifestations of VHL disease. Follow-up of families with germline mutations and limited VHL manifestations was recommended. This mutation was found in 2 VHL type 2A family members (family no. 23). Both had retinal hemangioblastomas, one had cerebellar hemangioblastomas, and one had pheochromocytoma.  Only supportive evidence for pathogenicity because patient’s phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology (ACMG code: PP4).\n",
      "- ID 10392: A pooled analysis of three phase 1/2 clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in 159 NTRK fusion positive solid tumor patients (1 month - 84 years old) confirmed larotrectinib to be effective and safe in these patients. NTRK2 fusions were found in 4 of the 159 patients. Two cases NTRK2 fusion cases were shown to have reduction in tumor size with another tumor showing only minor growth.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

      "- ID 11578: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion.  IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel revealed a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) fusion that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. Surgical resection was not an option due to tumor size and location. The patient was enrolled into a phase II trial and treated with 600mg of entrectinib daily. After 1 month, the mass showed near-complete loss of enhancement and density (Hounsfield units dropped from 200 to 55-60). At week 12, response plateau was reached with the lesion reducing by 45% (RECIST 1.1). Due to the exceptional response, vertebrectomy was possible and completed. The patient continued entrectinib and has been recurrence free for 7 months.\n",

Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and no IDH mutations were detected in these tumors. MYB (n=5) or MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangement fusions were detected in 41% (7/17) of diffuse astrocytomas, while the remaining tumors had alternations involving BRAF (n = 4), FGFR1/3 (n = 4), and others (n = 2). The gene partners involving MYB fusions in diffuse astrocytomas included PCDHGA1, LOC154902, and MMP16 and the gene parterners involivng MYBL included MMP16. In contrast, a MYB fusion (most frequently MYB::QKI) characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (14–15). Only one other tumor across the series (an oligodendroglioma) had a MYB fusion (MYB::MAML2). MYB/MYBL-altered LGNTs clustered together with methylation profiling. The findings in LGNT with a predominantly astrocytic phenotype associating with MYB/MYBL alterations suggest a role of MYB/MYBL in these tumor categories with distinct characteristics.\n",

All cases were confirmed by molecular testing to harbor YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions, 88% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 4 and 12% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 6. While conventional WWTR1::CAMTA1 EHE is characterized by relatively uniform morphology, YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma exhibits remarkable inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity with distinctive morphologic features not seen in conventional EHE. A striking clinical characteristic of YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma was that large proportion of patients survive many years with stable disease despite having multifocal disease and distant metastasis. The authors propose categorizing YAP1::TFE3 epithelioid hemangioendothelioma as a distinct disease entity from conventional epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (which typically harbors WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusions) due to its clinical and histopathologic characteristics.\n",

Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood.

      "- ID 1282: In this Phase II trial of 87 patients (NCT01871805), alectinib was assayed for safety and efficacy in ALK positive NSCLC that had progressed on crizotinib. Of 69 patients with measurable disease, 35 achieved objective response, with median duration of response 13.5 months. Of 16 patients with measurable CNS disease, four achieved CNS complete response and 8 showed CNS partial response. median duration of CNS response was 11.1 months. 2 deaths were observed, and 1 was judged related to study treatment.\n",
      "- ID 7284: In a phase 3 trial, 303 patients with NSCLC with ALK fusion were randomly assigned to alectinib arm (N=152) or crizotinib arm (N=151). PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than with crizotinib (HR for disease progression or death 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.65, p<0.001). Investigator-assessed RR was 82.9% in alectinib arm and 75.5% in crizotinib arm. CNS RR in patients with measurable CNS lesions was 81% and 50% for alectinib and crizotinib, respectively. Eight patients in the alectinib group, in comparison to one patient with crizotinib, had a complete CNS response. Despite longer treatment duration for alectinib, there were fewer grade 3-5 adverse events compared with crizotinib treatment.\n",
      "- ID 1273: In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.\n",
      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",
      "- ID 1279: In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.\n",

One of three patients experienced near-complete response by 8 months.\n",
      "- ID 11781: Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2). All five DA2 samples with 8q focal gains exhibited a common centromeric breakpoint within MYBL1 after exon 9, resulting in partial duplication of MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged DA2 demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication with the telomeric sequence located in MMP16. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional DA2s with MYBL1 partial duplication. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas (AGs) in the related gene MYB on 6q23.3. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined.

The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",
      "- ID 8931: The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 6099: Four out of six patients with infantile fibrosarcoma and a ETV6-NTRK3 fusion had a partial response, the remaining two had a complete response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",
      "- ID 12058: In this 2017 study, the authors utilized SNP arrays,  expression profiling, transcriptome, and whole-exome sequencing to further characterize sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS)/SEF hybrid tumors. The study included 13 tumors classified as pure SEF and six tumors from 4 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years. RNA-seq detected the EWSR1::CREB3L1 gene fusion in 8/13 pure SEF cases, with 2/13 positive for EWSR1::CREB3L2, and one each for FUS::CREM, FUS::CREB3L2, and PAX5::CREB3L1, while all hybrid tumors were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. SNP array showed both the pure SEF and hybrid tumors had multiple imbalances and structural rearrangements, and the authors suggest this could account for the poor outcome of SEF patients compared to LGFMS, which were found to be much less complex.\n",
      "- ID 10150: This study screened 983 Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) cases and identified 65 tumors with morphologic features suspicious of RCC with Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion (Xp11.2 RCC). TFE3 immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing confirmed 22 of these (34%) were Xp11.2 RCC.  TFE3 rearrangements define RCCs with Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion, which, in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, further belongs to the category of \"MiT family translocation renal cell carcinoma.\" The MiT family (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor family) translocation RCC comprises of the Xp11 translocation RCC harboring TFE3 gene fusions and the t(6;11) renal cell carcinoma harboring TFEB gene fusion. This study showed that the Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion RCC can be difficult to diagnose by pathology, and that evaluation by FISH is a useful diagnostic tool for this tumor type.\n",
      "- ID 12057: In this 2014 study, the authors compared 10 primary sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas (SEF), 4 cases of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), and one primary hybrid SEF/LGFMS. Patients with SEF ranged from 28 to 91 years of age. Using RT-PCR, they detected in-frame fusions in 3/4 cases with suitable samples, joining either exon 7, 8, or 11 of EWSR1 to exon 6 of CREB3L1. Split signals at EWSR1 and CREB3L1 were detected by FISH in an additional case. All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement. The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.\n",

VHL mutations were detected in affected family members, but not in unaffected family members or 96 normal individuals, however it seems unaffected family members were not tested genetically for the mutations. Mutations in the VHL gene were detected by SSCP and DNA sequencing. Haplotypes were determined with four microsatellite polymorphic probes. The missense mutation L184P (c.551T>C) (In the paper noted as nucleotide position 764 and codon position 255 due to old reference transcript), was found in 2 individuals in family 3708. Both individuals were identified with renal cell carcinoma and one also presented with a CNS hemangioblastoma. Additional information regarding the family information, including a pedigree, were not provided. ACMG evidence codes: 'flag for PP4' since the patients phenotype and family history is consistent with VHL, 'flag for PP1' because there is co-segregation of variant with the phenotype in two members of the family.\n",

Patient 1 presented with retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH) in her left eye at age the age of 13, which was treated with radiation. At age 62 years, this eye had good visual acuity (20/20) without any RCHs. As of her last visit, patient 1 also presented with abnormalities in the CNS, pancreas and kidney. She was found to have the L184P (c.551T>C) mutation. Her last known age was 69 years old. ACMG evidence codes: 'PP4' since the patient presents phenotypes highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 6119: Thirty-five unrelated patients suspected of having von Hippel-Lindau disease had genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes analyzed using sequence analysis of the coding region for VHL / Southern blot analyses. 32 VHL gene variants were found in 35 patients. An association of clear cell renal carcinoma development with a relatively high loss of structural stability in VHL protein missense mutations was discovered, although this only reached significance when combining data from other studies (p=0.101 for present study; p=0.0086 for present study + other study data). This missense variant was found in a patient with spinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, retinal hemangioblastomas, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, and cysts of the broad ligament (patient no. F43). The patient was 27 years old. ACMG PP4 as patient's phenotypes are highly specific for VHL disease.\n",

The c.551T>C (p.L184P) mutation was found in a family (Lineage 14) in which members were clinically diagnosed with VHL presenting without pheochromocytoma (VHL type 1), however, no further phenotypic information about specific patients was provided. This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript (AF010238.1). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot. Relevant ACMG codes include: PP4, because the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",

      "- ID 11530: In this 2012 paper, the authors assessed potential characteristic markers in 24 alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS cases), age range from 13 to 61 years, and 23 non-ASPS tumors. Nuclear immunoreactivity for the TFE3 protein was observed in 22 of 24 ASPS specimens. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion transcript was detected by RT-PCR in all 24 cases and was not detected in any of the 23 non-ASPS tumors. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 involves either exon 3 or 4 of TFE3 fused to ASPSCR1, which replaces the N-terminus of TFE3 but retains the DNA-binding region, activation domain, and nuclear localization signal. The fusion transcripts were composed of 7 type 1 (ASPCR1 fusion to TFE3 exon 4) and 17 type 2 (ASPCR1 fusion to TFE3 exon 3) transcripts.  The authors conclude that ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion detection is an effective diagnostic technique for ASPS.\n",

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RT-PCR, and sequencing of the product confirmed a SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene (SNX2 exon 3 fused in frame to ABL1 exon 4) was present. The patient also was found to carry an IKZF1 deletion (exons 2-8) and amplification of PAX5. The patient was treated with vindesine, idarubicin, and dexamethasone (VDP) and VDCP (plus cyclophosphamide) regimens. He received two bone marrow transplants, but eventually died of disease. The patient did not receive tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.\n",
      "- ID 7254: In a 29-year-old man with pre B-cell ALL, the t(5;9)(q23;q34) [SNX2-ABL1] was identified. The SNX2-ABL1 fusion, which joins the N-terminal domain of SNX2 without the PX domain to ABL1 exon 4, was detected by RACE PCR and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The patient responded to initial chemotherapy, but relapsed early. He then demonstrated a response to hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-C-VAD), but relapsed again. The patient next received imatinib and supportive measures, including hydroxycarbamide, but unfortunately succumbed to his disease approximately one year after diagnosis.\n",

The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is rare; in this study investigating 373 high risk pediatric B-ALL patients of which 29 demonstrated uncommon kinase gene fusions, only one case with SNX2-ABL1 (exon 3-exon 4) was observed. Gene expression profiles were compared to Ph-positive B-ALL and reportedly all fusion-containing samples (except P2RY8-CRLF2) were similar to BCR-ABL1-positive patients. This patient did not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered in combination with chemotherapy at the first or second relapses.\n",

Karyotype analysis showed a t(5;9)(q22;q34), resulting in a SNX2-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated based on the ALL-BFM95 regimen; although he received remission, he relapsed during maintenance, 15 months after the initial diagnosis. He could not achieve the second remission using chemotherapy, but was treated at this time with imatinib (dose of 240 mg/m2 /d once daily); this allowed to achieve disease control and proceed with an umbilical cord blood transplant. However, at 6 months from transplantation, the patient developed bone marrow relapse again. He never achieved a remission after the second relapse (despite salvage chemotherapies and therapy with both imatinib and dasatinib). The patient died of progressive disease.\n",
      "- ID 7241: A 7-yr-old boy with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia was found to harbor the SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene. Gene expression analysis showed enrichment for BCR-ABL1+ ALL using GSEA. After first relapse (15 months after diagnosis) the patient was given imatinib at a dose of 240 mg/m2/d once daily and his disease stabilized for 2 months. The patient received dasatinib (80 mg/m2/d once daily) after an umbilical cord blood transplant and did not respond to treatment. Patient was put back on imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/m2/d once daily which rapidly decreased the number of blast cells. However, 6 months after transplant he had bone marrow relapse and did not again achieve remission by the time of reporting.\n",

Next generation sequencing (RNAseq, WGS, and/or WES) performed on 154 Ph-like patients revealed 91% possessed genomic alterations activating kinase signaling with 96 (62%) involving rearrangements. In one adolescent male, an in-frame SNX2-ABL1 fusion (exon 3 and exon 4) with the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain intact was identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger. This patient, evaluated by WES and RNA-seq, also harbored IKZF1, EBF1, and VPREB deletions, and was designated Ph-like non CRLF2.\n",

Across the combined tRCC cohort, the majority of cases (78 cases; 88.6%) harbored TFE3 fusions, while the remainder harbored TFEB (8 cases; 9.1%) or MITF (2 cases; 2.3%) fusions.  Four different TFEB fusion partners were observed including CADM2, CLTC, COL21A1 and MALAT1. TFEB and MITF fusion partners tended to preserve less of the N-terminal fusion partner in the fusion product compared to TFE3. The authors conclude that most tRCCs harbor few somatic alterations apart from MiT/TFE fusions.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ABL1 SNX2::ABL1\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",
      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",
      "- ID 10392: A pooled analysis of three phase 1/2 clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in 159 NTRK fusion positive solid tumor patients (1 month - 84 years old) confirmed larotrectinib to be effective and safe in these patients. NTRK2 fusions were found in 4 of the 159 patients. Two cases NTRK2 fusion cases were shown to have reduction in tumor size with another tumor showing only minor growth.\n",
      "- ID 11776: Histological, molecular, and clinical analysis of 26 histologically prototypical isomorphic diffuse gliomas with a specific DNA methylation profile distinct from other glial/glio-neuronal brain tumors and normal hemispheric tissue were found to be most closely related to pediatric MYB/MYBL1-altered diffuse astrocytomas and angiocentric gliomas. IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing data demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Three tumors had MYB fusions with the gene partners, including HMG20A (n=1) and PCDHGA1 (n=2). These gene fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain and/or a loss of the negative regulatory 3' miRNA-binding sites with an associated increase in MYB expression. Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYB in 3 tumors, including one tumor with gains involving both MYB and HMG20A resulting in two different MYB::HMG20A fusions and two tumors without MYB fusions detected. Increased MYB expression was observed in four (4/6) tumors\n",

      "- ID 8854: Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based technique acquired quantitative measurement of the effect of S249C on unliganded mutant FGFR3 dimer stability and structure in plasma membrane vesicles from CHO cells. Dimer stability was modestly increased by S249C (-3.7 kcal/mol) versus wildtype FGFR3 (-3.4 kcal/mol). Intrinsic FRET demonstrated S249C dimers were significantly closer together (45 A) than the wildtype dimer (53 A). The substitution of cysteine was expected to lead to strong covalent bonds, but the authors conclude their data demonstrates S249C does not induce constitutive FGFR3 dimerization, but induces dimer structural modifications.\n",
      "- ID 7941: NIH-3T3 cells with the FGFR3 S249C extracellular domain mutation demonstrated an increase in colony formation compared to wild-type in an anchorage-independence assay, which was counteracted by the treatment with AP24534 or BGJ398. Xenograft assays showed similar results with all transforming FGFR3 mutations leading to increased tumor growth compared to wild-type.\n",
      "- ID 8853: In contrast to controls (empty vector and FGFR3 wildtype overexpression NIH-3T3 cell lines), the stable transfection of NIH-3T3 cells with FGFR3b-S249C led to ligand-independent phosphorylation of FGFR3 and the acquisition of elongated, refractile spindle-shaped morphology like transformed cells. Using a thymidine incorporation assay, S249C expressing cells were shown to lose contact inhibition and grew 3x to 4x more rapidly than controls. Soft agar assays demonstrated increased colony formation and anchorage independent growth in S249C expressing cells versus controls. All nude mice subcutaneously injected with S249C cells rapidly formed tumors, but no tumors were observed in empty vector injected mice. The authors conclude mutated FGFR3b-S249C has transforming properties attributed to oncogenes.\n",

Western blot revealed the ratio of phosphorylated-Akt/total Akt was higher in the 97-7 cells than in the wild-type cells, which was reversed by siRNA knockdown of FGFR3. Inhibition of Akt signaling by treatment with GDC0068 or LY294002 increased the cisplatin sensitivity of 97-7 cells (IC50 4.17ug/ml & 8.91ug/ml respectively).\n",

Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",

Metastatic lesions were found in the lung and spine. Pan-TRK immunostain was positive and RNA NGS detected a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion.

The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.\n",

The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",
      "- ID 7291: Integrated genomic analysis was performed for 1,988 childhood and adult B-ALL cases. Forty four cases (2.2%) showed the P80R substitution in the DNA binding domain for the PAX5 transcription factor gene. These cases were characterized by a unique expression profile. In the majority of the cases the mutation was hemizygous or homozygous, owing to deletion of the wild-type PAX5 allele or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. In 96% (42 of 44) of cases, the PAK5 P80R was accompanied by RAS and/or JAK-STAT signaling-pathway alterations (such as NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, NF1, IL7R), thereby suggesting cooperativity between deregulated PAX5 activity and kinase signaling.  The PAX5 P80R is proposed to define a distinct subtype of B-ALL.\n",

An EML4::NTRK3 (e2::e14) fusion was confirmed by RNA sequencing. This fusion was in-frame with breakpoints at exon 2 of EML4 and exon 14 of NTRK3. Stable lentiviral transduction of this fusion into NIH-3T3 cells induced soft agar colony growth in vitro and tumors in vivo.

      "- ID 6099: Four out of six patients with infantile fibrosarcoma and a ETV6-NTRK3 fusion had a partial response, the remaining two had a complete response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The claim that ETV6::NTRK3 is an oncogenic fusion in multiple cancer types is supported by evidence indicating its role in infantile fibrosarcoma, where a significant proportion of patients exhibited positive responses to larotrectinib treatment. Specifically, four out of six patients with the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion showed either partial or complete responses, highlighting the fusion's potential oncogenic nature. Additionally, the established presence of ETV6-related fusions in other cancers, such as ETV6-RUNX1 in leukemia, suggests a broader relevance of ETV6 fusions in oncogenesis. However, the evidence from RNA sequencing in B-cell ALL does not directly support the claim, indicating a need for further investigation into the specific roles of ETV6::NTRK3 across different cancer types.\"\n",

      "Evidence List:\n",
      "- ID 1122: HERA was a Phase III trial assessing application of trastuzumab in an extended adjuvant setting.  Patients were HER2 positive with completely excised invasive BC, node positive or negative, and having undergone prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.  In the 3 arm study patients were given trastuzumab courses of 1 year, 2 years, or untreated.  At the first planned interim analysis, trastuzumab treatment for one year was compared with observation alone.  A significant difference in disease-free survival was seen with 220 DFS events out of 1693 in the observation arm versus 127 DFS events out of 1694 in the 1 year trastuzumab arm.  1 year adjuvant trastuzumab is currently the standard of care.\n",
      "- ID 529: A randomized clinical trial of 186 patients with previously untreated, HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer demonstrated improved overall survival, response rate, response duration, time to progression, and time to treatment failure for patients who received trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy (docetaxel) compared to chemotherapy alone.\n",
      "- ID 1643: A DNAJB1:PRKACA fusion transcript was detected at very high expression levels by RNA-Seq in a case of mixed fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. Subsequent analysis revealed the presence of this fusion in all primary and metastatic samples, including those with mixed or conventional HCC pathology. A second case of mFL-HCC confirmed that the fusion was detectable in conventional components. An expanded screen of 112 additional HCC samples and 44 adjacent non-tumor liver samples was positive for a third case of HCC with both conventional and fibrolamellar features but negative for all conventional HCC and adjacent non-tumor liver samples.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ERBB2 Amplification\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\n",

Subsequent analysis revealed the presence of this fusion in all primary and metastatic samples, including those with mixed or conventional HCC pathology. A second case of mFL-HCC confirmed that the fusion was detectable in conventional components. An expanded screen of 112 additional HCC samples and 44 adjacent non-tumor liver samples was positive for a third case of HCC with both conventional and fibrolamellar features but negative for all conventional HCC and adjacent non-tumor liver samples.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ERBB2 Amplification\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\n",

Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.\n",
      "- ID 1189: In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.\n",

While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 1190: Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.\n",

      "- ID 11428: In an analysis of 13 cases of supratentorial glial tumors with ZFTA rearrangements without RELA involvement, all were found to have DNA methylation profiles similar to ZFTA::RELA supratentorial ependymoma.  The underlying ZFTA rearrangements included 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 fusions, 4 ZFTA::NCOA2 fusions, 3 ZFTA::MALM2 fusions, 1 novel MN1::ZFTA fusion, and a truncated ZFTA product.  Of the 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 in-frame fusions identified, 2 contained 4 zinc finger C2H2 domains of ZFTA at the N-terminus fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1 at the C terminus.  The third only contained 1 zinc finger C2H2 domain of ZFTA fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1.  Of note, the 1 case with only 1 zinc finger domain had a sarcoma-like histology rather than the more classic EPN-like histology.\n",
      "- ID 11539: A subset of renal neoplasms of children and young adults contains t(6;11)(p21;q12), fusion of the MALAT1 (Alpha) gene with the transcription factor gene TFEB. Argani, et al. (2005) included 7 renal neoplasms with cytogenetic and/or molecular evidence of the t(6;11)(p21;q12). The patients ranged from 9 to 33 years in age. All of the 7 renal neoplasms demonstrated either moderate or strong nuclear immunoreactivity for TFEB protein, and 1089 other neoplasms were tested but none showed significant labeling for TFEB. In 3 cases frozen tissue was available for RNA extraction, and RT-PCR detected the MALAT1(Alpha0::TFEB fusion. The potentially wide size range of MALAT1(Alpha)::TFEB fusion transcripts complicates the detection of this fusion by RT-PCR for robust detection in clinical RNA samples. The lack of splice signals in Alpha resulted in DNA PCR products of the same size as the RT-PCR products when the reverse primer binds to TFEB exon 3. The authors conclude that immunoreactivity for TFEB protein is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for these renal neoplasms and suggest that long-range DNA PCR may a useful alternative to RT-PCR due to the special molecular features of the Alpha::TFEB gene fusion.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

      "- ID 1198: This two arm Phase III study named PROFILE 1007 (NCT00932893) was performed to assess crizotinib vs. established chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients positive for ALK rearrangement (assessed by break-apart FISH) with locally advanced or metastatic disease. 347 patients with disease progression after one round of platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive crizotinib (N=173) or chemotherapy (N=174) consisting of pemetrexed in pemetrexed-naive patients and docetaxel for patients previously treated with pemetrexed. The primary endpoint - progression free survival (PFS) - was found to be significantly better for patients treated with crizotinib (median 7.7 months) than with chemotherapy (median 3.0 months) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001). Response rates were 65% for crizotinib treatment and 20% for chemotherapy (P<0.001). Improvements in quality of life were also reported.\n",
      "- ID 1199: This phase 3 trial named PROFILE 1014 (NCT01154140) compared crizotinib to established chemotherapy in first-line treatment for this disease. The study consisted of 343 patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC that tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break-apart FISH assay, and had no prior systemic treatment. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to crizotinib (N=172) or pemetrexed with cisplatin or carboplatin (N=171). Progression free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (10.9 vs. 7.0 months; hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.60;P<0.001), and objective response rate was higher with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (75% vs. 45%, P<0.001). Improvement in quality of life was also reported.\n",
      "- ID 1207: In the PROFILE 1001 study of crizotinib in 82 patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, 31 patients with sufficient tumor material were tested using RT-PCR for the presence of certain EML4-ALK variants.  13/31 tested patients had the EML4-ALK variant 1. Of these, 12/13 had a partial response, and 1 had stable disease. This response rate of 92% is in contrast to the 57% response rate in the overall patient population, but the numbers of patients with specific EML4-ALK breakpoints were insufficient to correlate with patient response rate.\n",
      "- ID 1356: In Ba/F3 cells, crizotinib sensitivty of the NPM-ALK variant was compared to crizotinib sensitivity of EML4-ALK variant 3. 50% of maximal inhibitory concentration for NPM-ALK was 42 nM, which was approximately 4x greater than IC50 of 11 nM obtained for EML4-ALK. The IC50 for parental Ba/F3 supplemented with IL3 was 2299 nM, resulting in a fold difference of 209.2 for EML4-ALK and 55.1 for NPM-ALK, indicating some reduced sensitivity for NPM-ALK in direct comparison to EML4-ALK, but substantial sensitization to crizotinib for NPM-ALK in Ba/F3 cells.\n",
      "- ID 4858: In a randomized, open-label phase 3 trial 303 patients with ALK-positive, previously untreated NSCLC (including asympt. CNS disease) were randomized to reiceive either Alectinib or Crizotinib. During a median follow-up of 17.6 months (crizotinib) and 18.6 months (alectinib), an event of disease progression/death occurred in 41% (62/152  pt) in the alectinib group and 68% (102/151 patients) in the crizotinib group. 12-month event-free survival rate 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib. A total of 18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an event of CNS progression, compared to 68 patients (45%) in the crizotinib group. Response rates were 82.9% (Alectinib) and 75.5% (crizotinib).\n",
      "- ID 1201: This prospective Phase III study named Profile 1014 on NSCLC ALK-rearranged patients assessed intracranial disease control rate (IC-DCR) in the subset of patients entering the study with preexisting treated brain metastasis (tBM). IC-DCR was significantly improved in the tBM group given crizotinib (N=39) over chemotherapy (pemetrexed + cisplatin or carboplatin; N=40) at 12 weeks (85% vs. 45%, P<0.001), and at 24 weeks (56% vs. 25%, P=0.006). Progression free survival was also significantly improved with crizotinib over chemotherapy in the tBM subgroup (9.0 vs. 4.0 months; HR 0.40; P<0.001), where in the intent to treat population it was 10.9 vs. 7.0 months (HR 0.45; P<0.001), indicating that the difficult to treat BM population obtained benefit from crizotinib at both the brain and systemic level.\n",
      "- ID 1419: In a retrospective study comparing survival outcomes in a subgroup of 82 ALK-positive crizotinib-treated patients enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT00585195), crizotinib therapy was associated with improved survival. For the crizotinib-treated, ALK-positive patient group, 1 year survival was 74% and 2 year overall survival was 54%, compared with 72% and 36% for the control group (ALK-positive crizotinib naive patients).\n",
      "- ID 1577: A phase-3 clinical trial evaluated 347 patients with ALK-positive lung cancer.  The study compared crizotinib treatment (n=173) with chemotherapy treatment of either pemetrexed or docetaxel (n=174).  In the crizotinib arm, the response rate was significantly higher (65% vs 20%; P<0.001), the progression-free survival was increased (7.7 months vs. 3.0 months; HR=0.49, 95%CI:14 months-26 months; p<0.001), however, there was no significant improvement in overall survival (HR=1.02; 95%CI:0.68-1.54; P=0.54).  Of the patients on crizotinib treatment, global quality of life was improved relative to baseline when compared to chemotherapy patients (+5 mean change, -5 mean change; P<0.001).\n",
      "- ID 1187: In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.\n",
      "- ID 1189: In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.\n",
      "- ID 1196: EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) were expressed in Ba/F3 cells using retrovirus.  While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 1190: Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.\n",
      "- ID 1197: Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) showed differential sensitivity to both crizotinib and TAE684, with variant 3a (E6;A20) being the least sensitive. The authors suggest that the type/structure of ALK fusion may have some impact on patient outcome in targeted therapy.\n",
      "- ID 11428: In an analysis of 13 cases of supratentorial glial tumors with ZFTA rearrangements without RELA involvement, all were found to have DNA methylation profiles similar to ZFTA::RELA supratentorial ependymoma.  The underlying ZFTA rearrangements included 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 fusions, 4 ZFTA::NCOA2 fusions, 3 ZFTA::MALM2 fusions, 1 novel MN1::ZFTA fusion, and a truncated ZFTA product.  Of the 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 in-frame fusions identified, 2 contained 4 zinc finger C2H2 domains of ZFTA at the N-terminus fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1 at the C terminus.  The third only contained 1 zinc finger C2H2 domain of ZFTA fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1.  Of note, the 1 case with only 1 zinc finger domain had a sarcoma-like histology rather than the more classic EPN-like histology.\n",
      "- ID 11539: A subset of renal neoplasms of children and young adults contains t(6;11)(p21;q12), fusion of the MALAT1 (Alpha) gene with the transcription factor gene TFEB. Argani, et al. (2005) included 7 renal neoplasms with cytogenetic and/or molecular evidence of the t(6;11)(p21;q12). The patients ranged from 9 to 33 years in age. All of the 7 renal neoplasms demonstrated either moderate or strong nuclear immunoreactivity for TFEB protein, and 1089 other neoplasms were tested but none showed significant labeling for TFEB. In 3 cases frozen tissue was available for RNA extraction, and RT-PCR detected the MALAT1(Alpha0::TFEB fusion. The potentially wide size range of MALAT1(Alpha)::TFEB fusion transcripts complicates the detection of this fusion by RT-PCR for robust detection in clinical RNA samples. The lack of splice signals in Alpha resulted in DNA PCR products of the same size as the RT-PCR products when the reverse primer binds to TFEB exon 3. The authors conclude that immunoreactivity for TFEB protein is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for these renal neoplasms and suggest that long-range DNA PCR may a useful alternative to RT-PCR due to the special molecular features of the Alpha::TFEB gene fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11279: In an analysis of 19 cases of mesoblastic nephroma, the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion was detected in 0 of 5 of the classic mesoblastic nephroma, 8 of 8 (100%) of the cellular mesoblastic nephroma and 5 of 6 (83%) of the mixed mesoblastic nephroma cohorts.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

      "The evidence regarding the presence of the R167Q mutation in multiple affected families enhances the explanatory power of the claim that it is a pathogenic variant for Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHLD) by demonstrating consistent cosegregation with the disease across different studies. In Evidence ID 5487, the R167Q mutation is associated with a high risk for pheochromocytoma and is found in families with multiple affected members, including those with retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas. Evidence ID 4913 further supports this by showing the mutation in several VHL type 2 families, with a significant number of individuals exhibiting related symptoms. The consistent presence of the mutation in affected individuals, but not in unaffected family members or controls, as shown in Evidence IDs 5264 and 4913, strengthens the argument for its pathogenicity.

      "The molecular profile of the R167Q variant contributes to the coherence of the evidence by demonstrating a specific genotype-phenotype correlation within VHL disease. This variant is a missense mutation found in six families with VHL type 2, which is associated with pheochromocytoma.

Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.  These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.\n",

Morphologic characteristics highly enriched in cases positive for t(8;21) included irregular nuclear shape, Auer bodies, at least 90% myeloperoxidase positivity in blast cells, pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly of the nuclei, and homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils. These features were observed in 90-100% of the t(8;21) positive cases and were rare in the t(8;21) negative group. Homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils was the most characteristic of t(8;21)positive AML-M2, while pale-colored cytoplasm without any granules in mature neutrophils or dyserythropoietic features was never observed in association with t(8;21). The study suggests association of the t(8;21) with a subtype of AML that has morphologically recognizable features in a high proportion of cases.

Median PFS was 9.7 months in the erlotinib group, compared with 5.2 months in the standard chemotherapy group.\n",
      "- ID 4265: MCF-7 cells were transduced with YFP tagged EGFR with E746_A750delELREA mutation, or YFP EGFR wildtype, and stained for ectopic YFP EGFR and phospho-Akt as a readout for EGFR pathway activity. Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.  These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.\n",
      "- ID 4290: In a prospective study of 46 Caucasian, advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients harboring EGFR mutations, first-line erlotinib treatment was assessed. Average PFS and OS for these 46 patients was 11 months (95% CI: 9.7-12.3 months) and 23 months (95% CI: 21.3-28.6+ months), respectively. A PFS rate of 81% at three months met the primary endpoint of presumed superiority over chemotherapy. Clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD) rate was 81%. Fifteen patients harbored EGFR L858R mutations, which was the only mutation found in exon 21. The authors note similar response profiles for exon 19 (27/46) and exon 21 mutations (15/46) to the overall population.\n",

Morphologic characteristics highly enriched in cases positive for t(8;21) included irregular nuclear shape, Auer bodies, at least 90% myeloperoxidase positivity in blast cells, pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly of the nuclei, and homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils. These features were observed in 90-100% of the t(8;21) positive cases and were rare in the t(8;21) negative group. Homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils was the most characteristic of t(8;21)positive AML-M2, while pale-colored cytoplasm without any granules in mature neutrophils or dyserythropoietic features was never observed in association with t(8;21). The study suggests association of the t(8;21) with a subtype of AML that has morphologically recognizable features in a high proportion of cases.  Of note, AML with t(8;21) translocation is now known to result in a RUNX1::RUNX1T fusion.\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The evidence supporting the claim that EGFR L858R positive NSCLC is sensitive to afatinib is robust, as numerous studies demonstrate significant tumor response rates and progression-free survival benefits in patients treated with afatinib. This aligns with established knowledge that EGFR mutations, particularly L858R, are associated with sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, some evidence suggests variability in response, indicating that while afatinib is generally effective, not all patients may experience the same level of benefit. Overall, the evidence coherently supports the claim, highlighting afatinib's role in targeted therapy for this specific mutation.\"\n",

In subsequent analysis, relapse or death occurred in 150/397 patients (38%) in the treatment group and 229/395 patients (58%) in the placebo group for a 95% CI Hazard Ratio of 0.48 (0.39-0.58).\n",

The hazard ratio for progression or death in the V600E group was 0.81 for dabrafenib-trametinib vs dabrafenib-alone. Of 179 V600E patients in the dabrafenib-trametinib group, 68% of patients had a response, which was 15 percentage points higher than in the dabrafenib-alone group (95% CI, 4 to 24; P=0.006).\n",
      "- ID 8854: Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based technique acquired quantitative measurement of the effect of S249C on unliganded mutant FGFR3 dimer stability and structure in plasma membrane vesicles from CHO cells. Dimer stability was modestly increased by S249C (-3.7 kcal/mol) versus wildtype FGFR3 (-3.4 kcal/mol). Intrinsic FRET demonstrated S249C dimers were significantly closer together (45 A) than the wildtype dimer (53 A). The substitution of cysteine was expected to lead to strong covalent bonds, but the authors conclude their data demonstrates S249C does not induce constitutive FGFR3 dimerization, but induces dimer structural modifications.\n",

A custom NGS panel identified a novel KANK1-NTRK2 fusion in both the classic and anaplastic regions. The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.\n",

      "The COMBO-AD trial (Evidence ID: 6178) demonstrates the effectiveness of dabrafenib and trametinib in treating BRAF V600E mutant melanoma by showing a significant reduction in relapse or death rates among patients receiving the treatment compared to those receiving a placebo. Specifically, 38% of patients in the treatment group experienced relapse or death, compared to 58% in the placebo group. This results in a hazard ratio of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.39-0.58), indicating that the treatment group had a 52% lower risk of relapse or death compared to the placebo group. The trial's large sample size of 792 patients with the V600E mutation further supports the robustness of these findings.

A total of eight patients had NTRK fusions, and by independent radiology review, all patients with TRK fusion were considered to have had an objective response. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion. Authors concluded that NTRK fusions may represent tissue and age agnostic oncogenic drivers, and that Larotrectinib was well tolerated in the patients and demonstrated activity in all tumors with NTRK fusions.\n",
      "- ID 978: NTRK1 fusions (one LMNA-NTRK1 and two TPM3-NTRK1) were identified in 2% of Korean colorectal cancer patients (147 patients). TrkA (NTRK1) protein expression was associated with presence of NTRK1 gene fusion. These fusions were mutually exclusive with other oncogenic drivers and showed in-vitro sensitivity to TrkA Inhibitor ARRY470  (Larotrectinib) (one cell line with fusion (KM12), one control cell line).\n",
      "- ID 2953: Results from a phase I study show that the TRK inhibitor LOXO-101 is well tolerated and effective, with patients whose tumors bear NTRK fusions responding well and durably to this targeted therapy. This publication reported results from an AACR meeting for an ongoing study that had enrolled six patients with NTRK fusions, three of whom could be evaluated at the time. Each had a different, heavily pretreated advanced disease: soft-tissue sarcoma; gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST); and MASC. All three patients experienced partial responses by 3-4 months with resolution of key tumour-related symptoms within two weeks. One of three patients experienced near-complete response by 8 months.\n",

      "- ID 7728: In this phase 3 trial (ADMIRAL), 371 patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML (required to have FLT3 ITD or TKD D835 or I836 mutations) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either gilteritinib (n=247, at a dose of 120 mg per day) or salvage chemotherapy (n=124). Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy.\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The claim that NTRK1 fusions predict sensitivity to Larotrectinib in solid tumors is supported by clinical evidence demonstrating that patients with these fusions often exhibit significant responses to the drug. Studies have shown that Larotrectinib effectively targets tumors with NTRK fusions, leading to durable responses across various solid tumor types. However, while the correlation is strong, it is essential to consider that not all patients with NTRK1 fusions respond uniformly, suggesting that other genetic or molecular factors may also influence treatment outcomes. Overall, the evidence largely supports the claim, but further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind the variability in response.\"\n",

The study included 17 EHE patients with a median age of 48 years (range 25–68). FISH analysis confirmed the translocation t(1;3)(1p36.23;3q25.1) in all EHE cases, and breakpoints were mapped to within WWTR1 and CAMTA1. Using RT-PCR they confirmed the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in the three tumors that had suitable tissue available. Exon 4 of WWTR1 was found to be fused to either exon 8 or exon 9 of CAMTA1. Of note, this fusion was not found in any other benign or malignant epithelioid vascular tumors examined, including 13 epithelioid hemangiomas, five epithelioid angiosarcomas, and four epithelioid sarcoma-like EHE. The authors conclude that t(1;3)(p36.23;q25.1) is a consistent genetic abnormality in EHEs of different anatomical locations and grades of malignancy.\n",

The authors identified an increase in endogenous phospho-SMAD1/5/8 signal in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) cells harboring ACVR1 G328V, with corresponding increase in phospho-SMAD1/5/8 staining as well. By PCR, the authors show strong increase in fold change of mRNA expression in downstream proteins of the ACVR1/BMP pathway, ID, ID2, ID3 and SNAI1 in ACVR1-mutant DIPG cell line compared to glioblastoma cells (KNS42 cells). These activating ACVR1 mutations were exclusively in midline high grade astrocytomas (P = 0.0040, Fisher's exact test).\n",
      "- ID 6955: In a study sequencing 61 patients (median age 6.3) with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), 12 variants affecting ACVR1 were observed. Five patients had G328V within the kinase domain. The ACVR1 G328V mutation was expressed using the pCDH511b vector in immortalized normal human astrocytes (iNHAs) where it activated downstream BMP signaling and enhanced cell growth. Activating ACVR1 mutations are recurrent and support diagnosis of high grade glioma. PEDIATRIC\n",

Median overall survival was found to differ by mutation, regardless of treatment. Median overall survival was 8.8 months (IQR 4.5-27) for patients with BRAF variants, 14.4 months (IQR 8.5-24.0) for patients with KRAS variants, and 20.1 months (IQR 11.5-31.7) for wildtype patients.

The study included 17 EHE patients with a median age of 48 years (range 25–68). FISH analysis confirmed the translocation t(1;3)(1p36.23;3q25.1) in all EHE cases, and breakpoints were mapped to within WWTR1 and CAMTA1. Using RT-PCR they confirmed the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in the three tumors that had suitable tissue available. Exon 4 of WWTR1 was found to be fused to either exon 8 or exon 9 of CAMTA1. Of note, this fusion was not found in any other benign or malignant epithelioid vascular tumors examined, including 13 epithelioid hemangiomas, five epithelioid angiosarcomas, and four epithelioid sarcoma-like EHE. The authors conclude that t(1;3)(p36.23;q25.1) is a consistent genetic abnormality in EHEs of different anatomical locations and grades of malignancy.\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The presence of ACVR1 mutations, particularly the G328V variant, in patients diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) provides compelling evidence supporting the diagnosis. Studies have shown that these mutations lead to increased activation of the BMP signaling pathway, which is associated with tumor growth and progression in high-grade gliomas. Specifically, sequencing studies have identified ACVR1 mutations in a significant proportion of DIPG cases, indicating a recurrent genetic alteration that aligns with the clinical characteristics of the disease. This genetic evidence, combined with the observed biological effects of the mutations, reinforces the hypothesis that ACVR1 mutations play a critical role in the pathogenesis of DIPG, thereby supporting the diagnosis of this aggressive brain tumor.\"\n",

The underlying ZFTA rearrangements included 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 fusions, 4 ZFTA::NCOA2 fusions, 3 ZFTA::MALM2 fusions, 1 novel MN1::ZFTA fusion, and a truncated ZFTA product.  Of the 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 in-frame fusions identified, 2 contained 4 zinc finger C2H2 domains of ZFTA at the N-terminus fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1 at the C terminus.  The third only contained 1 zinc finger C2H2 domain of ZFTA fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1.

The underlying ZFTA rearrangements included 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 fusions, 4 ZFTA::NCOA2 fusions, 3 ZFTA::MALM2 fusions, 1 novel MN1::ZFTA fusion, and a truncated ZFTA product.  Of the 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 in-frame fusions identified, 2 contained 4 zinc finger C2H2 domains of ZFTA at the N-terminus fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1 at the C terminus.  The third only contained 1 zinc finger C2H2 domain of ZFTA fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1.  Of note, the 1 case with only 1 zinc finger domain had a sarcoma-like histology rather than the more classic EPN-like histology.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.\n",

Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood.

The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.\n",

This missense mutation was found in a VHL type 1 patient and two VHL type 2B patients (patient no. V322, V36, V262). This study contains strong evidence of pathogenicity for this variant because the prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence In controls (ACMG code: PS4). No additional family members were screened in all 3 cases.\n",
      "- ID 5426: 43 unrelated VHL patients with previously sequenced VHL germline mutations and 36 suspected VHL mutation carriers were subject to denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) mutation screening. This mutation was found in 2  previously diagnosed VHL patients and a suspect VHL mutation carrier by DHPLC (family VHL 26, VHL 63, VHL 77). This variant results in an in frame deletion providing moderate evidence for pathogenicity (PM4).\n",
      "- ID 5203: In a study of 426 unrelated VHL patients, 111 were discovered to have alterations in the VHL gene. 18 novel variants were identified in VHL patients, but none were present in 200 unaffected control individuals. This deletion mutation was found in a 25 yr old VHL patient with multiple pancreatic cysts and hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system (index case 280). This study contains moderate support for pathogenicity because the protein length changes as a result changes as a result of in-frame deletions in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4).\n",
      "- ID 5750: This study reports 1,548 germline and somatic mutations from 945 VHL families. Mutation was detected in a VHL kindred with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, retinal hemangioblastomas and Grawitz tumor (also known as RCC) (case no. 2034). Protein length changes as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4). Patient's phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology (ACMG code: PP4).\n",

Cases were males aged 10 and 14 years who presented with advanced disease. With initial testing, both cases were negative for a BCOR ITD. However, RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing were able to detect a BCOR::CCNB3 gene fusion. The authors concluded that all reports of CCSK with a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion have been detected in males older than the typical age (<4 years of age) of presentation for CCSK, and recommend testing for the BCOR::CCNB3 fusion in CCSK patients lacking a BCOR ITD or YWHAE::NUTM2 gene fusion.\n",

Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.\n",

This nonsense mutation was found in 2 VHL families with 9 patients altogether. Eight had retinal hemangioblastoma, one had cerebellar hemangioblastomas, 3 had renal cell carcinoma, and 5 had pheochromcytoma.

      "- ID 12058: In this 2017 study, the authors utilized SNP arrays,  expression profiling, transcriptome, and whole-exome sequencing to further characterize sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS)/SEF hybrid tumors. The study included 13 tumors classified as pure SEF and six tumors from 4 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years. RNA-seq detected the EWSR1::CREB3L1 gene fusion in 8/13 pure SEF cases, with 2/13 positive for EWSR1::CREB3L2, and one each for FUS::CREM, FUS::CREB3L2, and PAX5::CREB3L1, while all hybrid tumors were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. SNP array showed both the pure SEF and hybrid tumors had multiple imbalances and structural rearrangements, and the authors suggest this could account for the poor outcome of SEF patients compared to LGFMS, which were found to be much less complex.\n",
      "- ID 12050: In this 2020 study, the authors included a total of 141 NUT carcinomas defined by rearrangement of NUTM1 detected by IHC, cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The median age at diagnosis was 24 years (range of 18 days to 80 years). Fusion partners were confirmed by either cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The majority  (78%) of tumors harbored a BRD4::NUTM1 fusion, 15% harbored a BRD3::NUTM1  fusion, 6% harbored a NSD3::NUTM1 fusion, 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF532::NUTM1 fusion and 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF592::NUTM1 fusion. For the remaining 14 cases the fusion partner gene to NUTM1 was not identified. The majority of tumors arose from the thorax or head and neck, but tumors were also seen in bone, soft tissue, and kidney. Outcomes in patients were overall poor, however, the authors conclude that they have identified three clinically and molecularly defined prognostic risk groups: group A is nonthoracic, BRD3::NUTM1, or NSD3::NUTM1 with a significantly improved prognosis (OS of 36.5 months); group B is nonthoracic, BRD4::NUTM1 with a poor prognosis (OS of 10 months); and group C is thoracic with a very poor prognosis (OS of 3.5 to 5.6 months) regardless of the NUTM1 fusion partner.\n",

This study included an number of other kinase fusions that did not have this effect arguing that it is a gain of function for the NTRK2 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 4290: In a prospective study of 46 Caucasian, advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients harboring EGFR mutations, first-line erlotinib treatment was assessed. Average PFS and OS for these 46 patients was 11 months (95% CI: 9.7-12.3 months) and 23 months (95% CI: 21.3-28.6+ months), respectively. A PFS rate of 81% at three months met the primary endpoint of presumed superiority over chemotherapy. Clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD) rate was 81%. Fifteen patients harbored EGFR L858R mutations, which was the only mutation found in exon 21.

      "- ID 5744: Genotype-phenotype correlations of 573 VHL patients were analyzed and confirmed that higher risk of pheochromocytoma is associated with missense mutations that result in substitution of a surface amino acid or that disrupt the structural integrity of the VHL gene product (pVHL). Age-related risks of retinal angiomas and renal cell carcinoma were higher in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations. This mutation was found in 4 unrelated families of 8 individuals total. 5 individuals had retinal hemangioblastomas, 4 had hemangioblastomas of the cerebellum, and 3 had renal cell carcinoma. ACMG evidence codes: 'PM4' because they observe a protein length change as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region or stop-loss variants, 'PP4' because the patients' phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 5134: Genotype-phenotype correlations of 573 VHL patients from 200 kindreds were analyzed. Age-related risks of retinal angiomas and renal cell carcinoma were higher in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations. This nonsense mutation was found in 2 VHL families with 9 patients altogether. Eight had retinal hemangioblastoma, one had cerebellar hemangioblastomas, 3 had renal cell carcinoma, and 5 had pheochromcytoma. This study contains very strong evidence for pathogenicity in the form of a frameshift mutation in a gene where loss-of-function is a known mechanism of disease (ACMG code: PVS1).\n",
      "- ID 5472: 53 patients with a molecularly confirmed VHL mutation and a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor were collected from the German NET-Registry and the German VHL-registry. 1 patient was found to have the above mutation. Other clinical manifestations outside of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor are possible, but were not discussed. ACMG evidence codes: 'PVS1' because they observe a nonsense variant in a gene where loss of function is a known mechanism of disease .\n",
      "- ID 5097: Molecular analysis of VHL gene in 146 probands, 103 with and 43 without a positive family history, resulted in the detection of 43 germline VHL mutations. Majority of mutations were found in patients with classic or multi-organ manifestations of VHL disease, but mutations were also found in patients with limited or single-organ manifestations of VHL disease. Follow-up of families with germline mutations and limited VHL manifestations was recommended. This mutation was found in 2 VHL type 2A family members (family no. 23). Both had retinal hemangioblastomas, one had cerebellar hemangioblastomas, and one had pheochromocytoma.  Only supportive evidence for pathogenicity because patient’s phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology (ACMG code: PP4).\n",
      "- ID 6623: Patients with ELSTs were identified and included in the International Endolymphatic Sac Tumor Registry. The registry contained 93 patients as of July 2014, and of those, 25 were sporadic, and 68 associated with VHL.  statistics of the VHL subgroup is as follows: mean age 30, 62% female, 91% symptomatic, 54% with retinal angioma, 72% with CNS hemangioblastoma, 46% with renal cell carcinoma, 19% with pheochromocytoma, 12% with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour.

All 7 patients were found to have Type 1 VHL disease. The mutations could not be found within 100 healthy controls. The above mutation was found in 1 member of a single family. The patient developed retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastoma. ACMG evidence codes: 'PP4' because the patient's phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with single genetic etiology, 'PVS1' because they observe a nonsense variant in a gene where loss of function is a known mechanism of disease.\n",
      "- ID 5404: Peripheral blood from unrelated patients with pheochromocytoma was tested for mutations of proto-oncogene RET, tumor suppressor gene VHL, succinate dehydrogenase subunit D (SDHD) gene, and the succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) gene. Of 271 patients with nonsydromic pheochromocytoma and no family history of the disease, 30 mutations were found in VHL. Multiple pheochromocytomas were statistically more frequent among patients with mutations than among patients without mutations (21 of 66 vs. 5 of 205, P<0.001). This nonsense mutation was found in the VHL gene and one patient with pheochromocytoma. This study contains very strong evidence of pathogenicity in the form of a nonsense variant in a gene where loss-of-function is a known mechanism of disease (ACMG code: PVS1).\n",
      "- ID 5360: Of 65 VHL families from central Europe, 53 were identified with germline mutations. This nonsense mutation was found in 2 German, VHL type 1 family members with retinal angiomas and hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system (family VHL 56). This study contains very strong evidence of pathogenicity in the form of a nonsense variant in a gene where loss-of-function is a known mechanism of disease (ACMG code: PVS1).\n",
      "- ID 12058: In this 2017 study, the authors utilized SNP arrays,  expression profiling, transcriptome, and whole-exome sequencing to further characterize sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS)/SEF hybrid tumors. The study included 13 tumors classified as pure SEF and six tumors from 4 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years. RNA-seq detected the EWSR1::CREB3L1 gene fusion in 8/13 pure SEF cases, with 2/13 positive for EWSR1::CREB3L2, and one each for FUS::CREM, FUS::CREB3L2, and PAX5::CREB3L1, while all hybrid tumors were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. SNP array showed both the pure SEF and hybrid tumors had multiple imbalances and structural rearrangements, and the authors suggest this could account for the poor outcome of SEF patients compared to LGFMS, which were found to be much less complex.\n",
      "- ID 12050: In this 2020 study, the authors included a total of 141 NUT carcinomas defined by rearrangement of NUTM1 detected by IHC, cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The median age at diagnosis was 24 years (range of 18 days to 80 years). Fusion partners were confirmed by either cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The majority  (78%) of tumors harbored a BRD4::NUTM1 fusion, 15% harbored a BRD3::NUTM1  fusion, 6% harbored a NSD3::NUTM1 fusion, 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF532::NUTM1 fusion and 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF592::NUTM1 fusion. For the remaining 14 cases the fusion partner gene to NUTM1 was not identified. The majority of tumors arose from the thorax or head and neck, but tumors were also seen in bone, soft tissue, and kidney. Outcomes in patients were overall poor, however, the authors conclude that they have identified three clinically and molecularly defined prognostic risk groups: group A is nonthoracic, BRD3::NUTM1, or NSD3::NUTM1 with a significantly improved prognosis (OS of 36.5 months); group B is nonthoracic, BRD4::NUTM1 with a poor prognosis (OS of 10 months); and group C is thoracic with a very poor prognosis (OS of 3.5 to 5.6 months) regardless of the NUTM1 fusion partner.\n",
      "- ID 11451: Authors demonstrated that a flag-tagged QKI::NTRK2 (e6::e16) fusion was able to transform  Ink4a−/−/Arf−/− astrocytes, and these cells induced astrocytomas when injected intracranially into mice.  This study included an number of other kinase fusions that did not have this effect arguing that it is a gain of function for the NTRK2 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 4290: In a prospective study of 46 Caucasian, advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients harboring EGFR mutations, first-line erlotinib treatment was assessed. Average PFS and OS for these 46 patients was 11 months (95% CI: 9.7-12.3 months) and 23 months (95% CI: 21.3-28.6+ months), respectively. A PFS rate of 81% at three months met the primary endpoint of presumed superiority over chemotherapy. Clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD) rate was 81%. Fifteen patients harbored EGFR L858R mutations, which was the only mutation found in exon 21. The authors note similar response profiles for exon 19 (27/46) and exon 21 mutations (15/46) to the overall population.\n",

      "The evidence strongly supports the claim that BRAF V600E mutations in colorectal cancer are associated with adverse pathological features and poor prognosis. In a study of 908 patients, those with BRAF V600E mutations were more likely to have proximal tumors, poor differentiation, mucinous carcinoma type, and lymphatic invasion, all of which are linked to worse outcomes. Specifically, the 3-year survival rate was significantly lower for the V600E group (63.8%) compared to the wild type group (87.9%). A meta-analysis further corroborates these findings, showing increased odds ratios for proximal lesions, T4 tumors, and poor differentiation in patients with BRAF mutations. Additionally, the Medical Research Council COIN trial found that patients with BRAF variants had a median overall survival of only 8.8 months, significantly shorter than those with KRAS variants or wildtype, highlighting the poor prognosis associated with BRAF V600E mutations.\n",

BRAF V600E mutations were more likely to be proximal tumors (68.9%, 20.7%; p<0.0001), they were more likely to be poorly differentiated (17.7%, 1.9%; p<0.0001), they were more likely to be mucinous carcinoma type (20.0%, 4.2%; p=0.0003), they were more likely to have lymphatic invasion (77.6%, 49.9%; p=0.0003), and they had a shorter survival time (31.1 mo, 41.6 mo; p=0.001).  The 3-year survival rate was significantly poorer in the V600E group when compared to the wild type group (63.8%, 87.9%; p<0.0001).\n",
      "- ID 7159: A meta analysis was performed using data from 21 published studies (n = 9885 patients) to assess prognostic value of BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer. When evaluating 14 studies (n = 7778 patients), the odds ratio (OR) of a proximal lesion, which is associated with greater mortality in colon cancer, was increased for patients with BRAF mutations (OR 5.222, 95% CI 3.801–7.174, P < 0.001). When evaluating 4 studies (n = 1526 patients), the odds ratio of T4 tumors, which indicates tumor growth past bowel lining, was increased for patients with BRAF mutations (OR 1.761, 95% CI 1.164–2.663, P = 0.007). When evaluating 8 studies (n = 2786 patients), the odds ratio of poor tumor differentiation was increased in patients with BRAF mutations (OR 3.816, 95% CI 2.714–5.365, P < 0.001). These results support that BRAF mutations indicate poor prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer.\n",

Of the 1,307 FFPE samples tested, V600E was observed in 31 Stage II samples (7.6%) and 72 Stage III samples (7.9%). V600E was prognostic for overall survival, but not for relapse-free survival, in patients with stages II and III combined, and in stage III alone. For all MSI low and stable tumors, BRAF V600E positive samples had a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.19 (95% CI, 1.43 to 3.37, P=0.00034). For all samples in the cohort (MSI-H and MSI-L) BRAF V600E positive samples had a 1.66 HR (95% CI, 1.15 to 2.40, P=0.0069).

Median overall survival was found to differ by mutation, regardless of treatment. Median overall survival was 8.8 months (IQR 4.5-27) for patients with BRAF variants, 14.4 months (IQR 8.5-24.0) for patients with KRAS variants, and 20.1 months (IQR 11.5-31.7) for wildtype patients.

The tumors showed low-grade histopathologic features and were broadly classified as diffuse astrocytoma (n = 11) or angiocentric glioma (n=35). Molecular alterations interrogated by immunohistochemistry (n=46), RNA sequencing (n=29), FISH (n=24), or PCR-based sequencing (n=11) revealed MYB (n=44) or MYBL1 (n=2) alterations in all tumors. MYB and MYBL1 were fused with various gene partners. None had alterations in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, ATRX, or histone H3 genes. Regardless of histopathologic diagnosis or anatomic location, DNA methylome profiling on 35 MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas formed a single cluster, supporting that MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas represent a single disease entity with a range of clinical and pathologic characteristics. Only MYB rearrangements were detected in angiocentric gliomas.

Thirteen FFPE samples of MC (9 females, 4 males) from ages 19 to 54 and Eighteen cases of meningeal HPC (8 females, 10 males) from ages from 24 to 73 years were tested using RT-PCR for the presence of HEY1-NCOA2 fusion.

The tumors showed low-grade histopathologic features and were broadly classified as diffuse astrocytoma (n = 11) or angiocentric glioma (n=35). Molecular alterations interrogated by immunohistochemistry (n=46), RNA sequencing (n=29), FISH (n=24), or PCR-based sequencing (n=11) revealed MYB (n=44) or MYBL1 (n=2) alterations in all tumors. MYB and MYBL1 were fused with various gene partners. None had alterations in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, ATRX, or histone H3 genes. Regardless of histopathologic diagnosis or anatomic location, DNA methylome profiling on 35 MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas formed a single cluster, supporting that MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas represent a single disease entity with a range of clinical and pathologic characteristics. Only MYB rearrangements were detected in angiocentric gliomas. Of the 35 angiocentric gliomas, 22 had identified gene partners, primarily QKI (n=19), PCDHGA1 (n=1), LOC105378099 (n=1) and ESR1 (n=1).\n",

      "Gilteritinib targets FLT3 D835 mutations by inhibiting the kinase activity through interaction at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835-containing activation loop. This allows gilteritinib to effectively inhibit kinase activity even in the presence of the D835 mutation, which can confer resistance to other therapies. The drug reduces phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated in both cell lines and animal models. This mechanism of action enhances its effectiveness compared to other therapies that may not effectively target the D835 mutation, as evidenced by its ability to induce tumor regression in xenograft models and its cytotoxicity in patient-derived samples with D835Y mutations. Additionally, gilteritinib's low IC50 values in inhibiting cell growth and FLT3 phosphorylation highlight its potency against these mutations.\n",

      "- ID 8106: Gilteritinib inhibited the cell growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y (IC50 1.6 nM; 95% CI: 1.1–2.4 nM) compared to controls (IC50 420nM; 95% CI: 350–500 nM). Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop. This inhibitory mechanism allows for kinase inhibition to occur in the face of D835 mutation.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

      "- ID 4858: In a randomized, open-label phase 3 trial 303 patients with ALK-positive, previously untreated NSCLC (including asympt. CNS disease) were randomized to reiceive either Alectinib or Crizotinib. During a median follow-up of 17.6 months (crizotinib) and 18.6 months (alectinib), an event of disease progression/death occurred in 41% (62/152  pt) in the alectinib group and 68% (102/151 patients) in the crizotinib group. 12-month event-free survival rate 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib. A total of 18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an event of CNS progression, compared to 68 patients (45%) in the crizotinib group. Response rates were 82.9% (Alectinib) and 75.5% (crizotinib).\n",
      "- ID 1282: In this Phase II trial of 87 patients (NCT01871805), alectinib was assayed for safety and efficacy in ALK positive NSCLC that had progressed on crizotinib. Of 69 patients with measurable disease, 35 achieved objective response, with median duration of response 13.5 months. Of 16 patients with measurable CNS disease, four achieved CNS complete response and 8 showed CNS partial response. median duration of CNS response was 11.1 months. 2 deaths were observed, and 1 was judged related to study treatment.\n",
      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",
      "- ID 1190: Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.\n",
      "- ID 1187: In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.\n",
      "- ID 1199: This phase 3 trial named PROFILE 1014 (NCT01154140) compared crizotinib to established chemotherapy in first-line treatment for this disease. The study consisted of 343 patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC that tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break-apart FISH assay, and had no prior systemic treatment. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to crizotinib (N=172) or pemetrexed with cisplatin or carboplatin (N=171). Progression free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (10.9 vs. 7.0 months; hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.60;P<0.001), and objective response rate was higher with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (75% vs. 45%, P<0.001). Improvement in quality of life was also reported.\n",
      "- ID 1198: This two arm Phase III study named PROFILE 1007 (NCT00932893) was performed to assess crizotinib vs. established chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients positive for ALK rearrangement (assessed by break-apart FISH) with locally advanced or metastatic disease. 347 patients with disease progression after one round of platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive crizotinib (N=173) or chemotherapy (N=174) consisting of pemetrexed in pemetrexed-naive patients and docetaxel for patients previously treated with pemetrexed. The primary endpoint - progression free survival (PFS) - was found to be significantly better for patients treated with crizotinib (median 7.7 months) than with chemotherapy (median 3.0 months) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001). Response rates were 65% for crizotinib treatment and 20% for chemotherapy (P<0.001). Improvements in quality of life were also reported.\n",
      "- ID 1189: In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.\n",
      "- ID 7284: In a phase 3 trial, 303 patients with NSCLC with ALK fusion were randomly assigned to alectinib arm (N=152) or crizotinib arm (N=151). PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than with crizotinib (HR for disease progression or death 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.65, p<0.001). Investigator-assessed RR was 82.9% in alectinib arm and 75.5% in crizotinib arm. CNS RR in patients with measurable CNS lesions was 81% and 50% for alectinib and crizotinib, respectively. Eight patients in the alectinib group, in comparison to one patient with crizotinib, had a complete CNS response. Despite longer treatment duration for alectinib, there were fewer grade 3-5 adverse events compared with crizotinib treatment.\n",
      "- ID 1279: In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.\n",
      "- ID 8657: A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).\n",
      "- ID 1691: In an evaluation of a patient with crizotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma, an EML4-ALK-E13;A20 rearrangement was identified using CGP.  The patient attained a reduction in the target lesions by 14.2%, however, the patient relapsed 17 months later.\n",
      "- ID 1665: 90 NSCLC patients with stage IIIB/IV chemotherapy-resistant tumors were treated with gefitinib, and the L858R EGFR mutation was associated with longer time to treatment failure than those with wild-type EGFR (median 9.1 versus 2.1). In multivariate analysis, L858R mutations plus adenocarcinoma was a significant predictive factor for time to treatment failure (HR = 0.1030; P = .0004).\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

The refractory or relapsed AML FLT wildtype group treated with gilteritinib(n=58) had lower overall response rate (12%), complete remission (2%), complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (0%), complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery (7%), and fewer reached partiral remission (3%). Also, bone marrow myeloblast reduction was greater in FLT3 mutant patients compared to FLT3 wildtype.\n",
      "- ID 8923: This study was designed to test the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in vitro against FLT3-ITD and other TKD variants clinically observed. IC50s were determined from immunoblots quantifying FLT3 phosphorylation in endogenous (Molm14) or ectopic expression FLT3-ITD cell lines (TF-1, Ba/F3) and the endogenous wildtype FLT3 SEMK2 cell line after gilteritinib treatment. IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib.

      "- ID 8924: In vitro gilteritinib treatment of MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells, which endogenously express FLT3-ITD, showed growth suppression based on CellTiter GLO cytotoxicity assays with IC50 values of 0.92 nM (95% CI: 0.23–3.6 nM) and 2.9 nM (95% CI: 1.4–5.8 nM), respectively. Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15. Gilteritinib treated mice showed significantly less widespread disease at day 42 than control counterparts (N=10, p<0.001) and significantly improved survival (log-rank, p<0.001).\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.\n",

      "- ID 7993: Case report of a 61-year-old man with B-ALL. An initial analysis detected the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion and a NRASGly12Asp mutation. Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).\n",
      "- ID 8930: Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis of a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk) revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 8917: All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",
      "- ID 8931: The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration.

      "The evidence supporting larotrectinib's effectiveness is robust, as demonstrated by multiple studies showing significant tumor response in patients with NTRK fusion-positive tumors. In a pooled analysis of 159 patients, larotrectinib was confirmed to be effective and safe, with a high overall response rate of 75-80% in various age groups and tumor types. However, variability in patient responses can occur due to genetic factors, such as mutations in the NTRK1 kinase domain, which significantly reduce larotrectinib's activity, as seen in the head-to-head comparison study. The IC50 values for LMNA:NTRK1 fusions with kinase domain mutations were much higher, indicating reduced drug efficacy. This suggests that while larotrectinib is generally effective, its efficacy can be compromised by specific genetic mutations, highlighting the importance of genetic profiling in treatment planning.\n",

      "- ID 9588: One patient was identified with a LMNA-NTRK1 positive tumor in this Phase I study (NCT02122913), which involved 70 heavily pretreated patients with a median age of 59.5 years, with multiple solid tumor types. A total of eight patients had NTRK fusions, and by independent radiology review, all patients with TRK fusion were considered to have had an objective response. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion. Authors concluded that NTRK fusions may represent tissue and age agnostic oncogenic drivers, and that Larotrectinib was well tolerated in the patients and demonstrated activity in all tumors with NTRK fusions.\n",
      "- ID 11349: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, the first generation inhibitor larotrectinib was 28-150 fold less active against fusions with mutations in the NTRK1 kinase domain.  The IC50 for LMNA:NTRK1 with no mutation was 23.5 nM while the IC50s for the LMNA:NTRK1 fusion with G595R (solvent front), F589L (gatekeeper), or G667C (xDFG) mutation were 3540, 675, and 1630 nM respectively.\n",
      "- ID 10392: A pooled analysis of three phase 1/2 clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in 159 NTRK fusion positive solid tumor patients (1 month - 84 years old) confirmed larotrectinib to be effective and safe in these patients. NTRK2 fusions were found in 4 of the 159 patients. Two cases NTRK2 fusion cases were shown to have reduction in tumor size with another tumor showing only minor growth.\n",
      "- ID 6568: This was a Phase 1/2 study of 55 patients from 4 months to 76 years old with TRK-fusion positive tumors given NTRK inhibitor Larotrectinib. Patients had 17 unique NTRK fusion types. Patient overall response rate was 75% according to independent review and 80% according to investigator assessment. Authors state that Larotrectinib had durable anti tumor activity regardless of age or tumor type. 26/27 patients with NTRK3-fusion showed maximum percent change in tumor size between -30% and -100%.\n",
      "- ID 7496: In this phase 1 dose-escalation study seventy patients with metastatic solid tumours were enrolled. Eight patient tumours were found to harbour NTRK gene fusions, six of which were ETV6-NTRK3. Treatment with larotrectinib resulted in reduced tumour burden for all patients with NTRK fusions.

Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).\n",
      "- ID 8930: Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis of a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk) revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 8917: All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",
      "- ID 8931: The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",

Patient 1 presented with retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH) in her left eye at age the age of 13, which was treated with radiation. At age 62 years, this eye had good visual acuity (20/20) without any RCHs. As of her last visit, patient 1 also presented with abnormalities in the CNS, pancreas and kidney. She was found to have the L184P (c.551T>C) mutation. Her last known age was 69 years old.

VHL mutations were detected in affected family members, but not in unaffected family members or 96 normal individuals, however it seems unaffected family members were not tested genetically for the mutations. Mutations in the VHL gene were detected by SSCP and DNA sequencing. Haplotypes were determined with four microsatellite polymorphic probes. The missense mutation L184P (c.551T>C) (In the paper noted as nucleotide position 764 and codon position 255 due to old reference transcript), was found in 2 individuals in family 3708. Both individuals were identified with renal cell carcinoma and one also presented with a CNS hemangioblastoma. Additional information regarding the family information, including a pedigree, were not provided. ACMG evidence codes: 'flag for PP4' since the patients phenotype and family history is consistent with VHL, 'flag for PP1' because there is co-segregation of variant with the phenotype in two members of the family.\n",
      "- ID 5264: Screening of 92 unrelated patients with VHL disease revealed 61 DNA variants. No variants were found in 96 control cases. This missense mutation was found in a VHL type 1 patient and two VHL type 2B patients (patient no. V322, V36, V262). This study contains strong evidence of pathogenicity for this variant because the prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence In controls (ACMG code: PS4). No additional family members were screened in all 3 cases.\n",
      "- ID 8491: Of 14 patients with retinal vascular proliferation and known family history of VHL disease, 12 patients were enrolled in an approved study protocol at the National Cancer Institute. 11 of these patients underwent genetic testing and were found to have mutations in the VHL gene. Patient 1 presented with retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH) in her left eye at age the age of 13, which was treated with radiation. At age 62 years, this eye had good visual acuity (20/20) without any RCHs. As of her last visit, patient 1 also presented with abnormalities in the CNS, pancreas and kidney. She was found to have the L184P (c.551T>C) mutation. Her last known age was 69 years old. ACMG evidence codes: 'PP4' since the patient presents phenotypes highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 6119: Thirty-five unrelated patients suspected of having von Hippel-Lindau disease had genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes analyzed using sequence analysis of the coding region for VHL / Southern blot analyses. 32 VHL gene variants were found in 35 patients. An association of clear cell renal carcinoma development with a relatively high loss of structural stability in VHL protein missense mutations was discovered, although this only reached significance when combining data from other studies (p=0.101 for present study; p=0.0086 for present study + other study data). This missense variant was found in a patient with spinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, retinal hemangioblastomas, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, and cysts of the broad ligament (patient no. F43). The patient was 27 years old. ACMG PP4 as patient's phenotypes are highly specific for VHL disease.\n",

This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript (AF010238.1). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot. Relevant ACMG codes include: PP4, because the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",

      "- ID 9177: This retrospective study intended to clarify clinical characteristics of patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL) and kinase fusions that are not well described (excluding ETV6-RUNX1, E2A-PBX1, MLL rearrangements and BCR-ABL). The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is rare; in this study investigating 373 high risk pediatric B-ALL patients of which 29 demonstrated uncommon kinase gene fusions, only one case with SNX2-ABL1 (exon 3-exon 4) was observed. Gene expression profiles were compared to Ph-positive B-ALL and reportedly all fusion-containing samples (except P2RY8-CRLF2) were similar to BCR-ABL1-positive patients. This patient did not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered in combination with chemotherapy at the first or second relapses.\n",
      "- ID 7744: This case report describes a 7-year old boy with B-ALL who presented with high white blood count (115.4x109 /L). Karyotype analysis showed a t(5;9)(q22;q34), resulting in a SNX2-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated based on the ALL-BFM95 regimen; although he received remission, he relapsed during maintenance, 15 months after the initial diagnosis. He could not achieve the second remission using chemotherapy, but was treated at this time with imatinib (dose of 240 mg/m2 /d once daily); this allowed to achieve disease control and proceed with an umbilical cord blood transplant. However, at 6 months from transplantation, the patient developed bone marrow relapse again. He never achieved a remission after the second relapse (despite salvage chemotherapies and therapy with both imatinib and dasatinib). The patient died of progressive disease.\n",
      "- ID 7241: A 7-yr-old boy with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia was found to harbor the SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene. Gene expression analysis showed enrichment for BCR-ABL1+ ALL using GSEA. After first relapse (15 months after diagnosis) the patient was given imatinib at a dose of 240 mg/m2/d once daily and his disease stabilized for 2 months. The patient received dasatinib (80 mg/m2/d once daily) after an umbilical cord blood transplant and did not respond to treatment. Patient was put back on imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/m2/d once daily which rapidly decreased the number of blast cells. However, 6 months after transplant he had bone marrow relapse and did not again achieve remission by the time of reporting.\n",
      "- ID 9178: In the study involving 1725 B-ALL patients, 264 were identified by microarray-based algorithm to have a Ph-like expression signature. Next generation sequencing (RNAseq, WGS, and/or WES) performed on 154 Ph-like patients revealed 91% possessed genomic alterations activating kinase signaling with 96 (62%) involving rearrangements. In one adolescent male, an in-frame SNX2-ABL1 fusion (exon 3 and exon 4) with the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain intact was identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger. This patient, evaluated by WES and RNA-seq, also harbored IKZF1, EBF1, and VPREB deletions, and was designated Ph-like non CRLF2.\n",
      "- ID 10337: Molecular analysis of 30 Ewing tumors (designated as Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) in this 1994 paper) from patients with well-documented clinical course was performed.   RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28).  Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses.  19 of 28 (67%) were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex6 (type I), 4 of 28  (14%)  were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex5 (type II) and there was 1 each of EWSR1 ex7:: FLI1 ex7, EWSR1 ex 10::FLI1 ex 5, and EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4.  This last tumor (EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4) had evidence of an additional 4 splicing variants corresponding to EWSR1 exon 7 to FLI1 exons 4, 6, 8 and 9.  Two tumors had EWSR1::ERG with breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG.  Of note, karyotyping only revealed a chromosome 22 rearrangement in 18 out of 27 cases tested (67%), however this was thought to be due to failure to obtain mitotic figures (5 of 9) and insufficient  material (4 of 9).  Authors conclude RT-PCR is better than karyotyping for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors. In this small study, EWSR::FLI1 type I fusion predominated over type II in localized Ewing's and were more abundant in tumors affecting the long bones (9 versus 0), however no correlations between different EWSR1 transcripts and any other clinical parameters could be identified.\n",
      "- ID 11784: In this 2016 study Kenny et al. included 159 cases of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). RNA was extracted from either snap-frozen or FFPE tumour tissue samples and real-time PCR used to identify YWHAE::NUTM2 fusions. Of the 102 cases tested, 2 (2%) were positive for the YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript. The two cases were both aged less than a year (mean of 9 months), both male, and disease stage II or III/IV.  The YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript is present in only a minority of CCSKs, however the observation of the same rearrangement in high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, suggests this translocation is oncogenic.\n",

      "Additional Information:\n",
      "- Molecular Profile: ABL1 SNX2::ABL1\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

      "The rarity of kinase fusions like SNX2-ABL1 in B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL) suggests that while they may play a role in individual cases, they are not common drivers of the disease overall. In the study of 373 high-risk pediatric B-ALL patients, only one case exhibited the SNX2-ABL1 fusion, indicating its infrequent occurrence. The similarity in gene expression profiles between fusion-containing samples and BCR-ABL1-positive patients suggests that these rare fusions might share some pathogenic mechanisms with more common fusions. However, the lack of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the SNX2-ABL1 case highlights the complexity and potential variability in treatment response. Overall, while these rare fusions can provide insights into specific cases, their significance in the broader pathogenesis of B-ALL remains limited due to their infrequency.\n",

      "The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is indeed rare, as evidenced by its occurrence in only a few documented cases among high-risk B-ALL patients. This rarity poses a significant challenge in understanding its role in Ph-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia, as the limited number of cases restricts the ability to conduct large-scale studies or draw definitive conclusions. The available cases show varied responses to treatment, with some patients initially responding to chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib, but often experiencing relapses. The inconsistency in treatment outcomes further complicates the understanding of SNX2-ABL1's role and its potential as a therapeutic target.

In this study, screening of umbilical cord blood samples from 340 healthy newborns, the TCF3::PBX1 fusion was found in 2 cases (0.6%) using a method that is called GIPFEL(genomic inverse PCR for ligated breakpoints). Although  no followup on these children was conducted,  the study suggest that B-lymphoblastic leukemia with TCF3::PBX1 fusion at least in some cases may have prenatal origin.\n",
      "- ID 7254: In a 29-year-old man with pre B-cell ALL, the t(5;9)(q23;q34) [SNX2-ABL1] was identified. The SNX2-ABL1 fusion, which joins the N-terminal domain of SNX2 without the PX domain to ABL1 exon 4, was detected by RACE PCR and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The patient responded to initial chemotherapy, but relapsed early. He then demonstrated a response to hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-C-VAD), but relapsed again. The patient next received imatinib and supportive measures, including hydroxycarbamide, but unfortunately succumbed to his disease approximately one year after diagnosis.\n",

The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is rare; in this study investigating 373 high risk pediatric B-ALL patients of which 29 demonstrated uncommon kinase gene fusions, only one case with SNX2-ABL1 (exon 3-exon 4) was observed. Gene expression profiles were compared to Ph-positive B-ALL and reportedly all fusion-containing samples (except P2RY8-CRLF2) were similar to BCR-ABL1-positive patients. This patient did not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered in combination with chemotherapy at the first or second relapses.\n",
      "- ID 7744: This case report describes a 7-year old boy with B-ALL who presented with high white blood count (115.4x109 /L). Karyotype analysis showed a t(5;9)(q22;q34), resulting in a SNX2-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated based on the ALL-BFM95 regimen; although he received remission, he relapsed during maintenance, 15 months after the initial diagnosis. He could not achieve the second remission using chemotherapy, but was treated at this time with imatinib (dose of 240 mg/m2 /d once daily); this allowed to achieve disease control and proceed with an umbilical cord blood transplant. However, at 6 months from transplantation, the patient developed bone marrow relapse again. He never achieved a remission after the second relapse (despite salvage chemotherapies and therapy with both imatinib and dasatinib). The patient died of progressive disease.\n",
      "- ID 7241: A 7-yr-old boy with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia was found to harbor the SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene. Gene expression analysis showed enrichment for BCR-ABL1+ ALL using GSEA. After first relapse (15 months after diagnosis) the patient was given imatinib at a dose of 240 mg/m2/d once daily and his disease stabilized for 2 months. The patient received dasatinib (80 mg/m2/d once daily) after an umbilical cord blood transplant and did not respond to treatment. Patient was put back on imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/m2/d once daily which rapidly decreased the number of blast cells. However, 6 months after transplant he had bone marrow relapse and did not again achieve remission by the time of reporting.\n",

In one adolescent male, an in-frame SNX2-ABL1 fusion (exon 3 and exon 4) with the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain intact was identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger. This patient, evaluated by WES and RNA-seq, also harbored IKZF1, EBF1, and VPREB deletions, and was designated Ph-like non CRLF2.\n",
      "- ID 10337: Molecular analysis of 30 Ewing tumors (designated as Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) in this 1994 paper) from patients with well-documented clinical course was performed.   RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28).  Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses.  19 of 28 (67%) were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex6 (type I), 4 of 28  (14%)  were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex5 (type II) and there was 1 each of EWSR1 ex7:: FLI1 ex7, EWSR1 ex 10::FLI1 ex 5, and EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4.  This last tumor (EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4) had evidence of an additional 4 splicing variants corresponding to EWSR1 exon 7 to FLI1 exons 4, 6, 8 and 9.  Two tumors had EWSR1::ERG with breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG.  Of note, karyotyping only revealed a chromosome 22 rearrangement in 18 out of 27 cases tested (67%), however this was thought to be due to failure to obtain mitotic figures (5 of 9) and insufficient  material (4 of 9).  Authors conclude RT-PCR is better than karyotyping for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors. In this small study, EWSR::FLI1 type I fusion predominated over type II in localized Ewing's and were more abundant in tumors affecting the long bones (9 versus 0), however no correlations between different EWSR1 transcripts and any other clinical parameters could be identified.\n",

RNA was extracted from either snap-frozen or FFPE tumour tissue samples and real-time PCR used to identify YWHAE::NUTM2 fusions. Of the 102 cases tested, 2 (2%) were positive for the YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript. The two cases were both aged less than a year (mean of 9 months), both male, and disease stage II or III/IV.  The YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript is present in only a minority of CCSKs, however the observation of the same rearrangement in high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, suggests this translocation is oncogenic.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ABL1 SNX2::ABL1\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",

      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",
      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",
      "- ID 10392: A pooled analysis of three phase 1/2 clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in 159 NTRK fusion positive solid tumor patients (1 month - 84 years old) confirmed larotrectinib to be effective and safe in these patients. NTRK2 fusions were found in 4 of the 159 patients. Two cases NTRK2 fusion cases were shown to have reduction in tumor size with another tumor showing only minor growth.\n",

This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript (AF010238.1). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot. Relevant ACMG codes include: PP4, because the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",

Evidence from NIH-3T3 cell studies shows that cells expressing FGFR3 S249C exhibit increased colony formation and growth rates compared to wild-type, indicating a loss of contact inhibition and anchorage independence. Additionally, xenograft assays confirm that these cells form tumors more readily than controls, supporting the claim of oncogenic potential. This aligns with the broader understanding of FGFR3 mutations in cancer biology, where such alterations are linked to aggressive tumor behavior and poor clinical outcomes.\"\n",

      "The case study of the 41-year-old man supports the oncogenic classification of KANK1::NTRK2 by demonstrating its association with high-grade sarcoma characteristics. The presence of large rhabdoid/epithelioid cell morphology and retained H3K27Me3, along with metastatic lesions in the lung and spine, indicates aggressive tumor behavior. The positive pan-TRK immunostain and the detection of the KANK1::NTRK2 fusion through RNA NGS suggest a novel genetic alteration contributing to the malignancy. This fusion is reported for the first time in a sarcoma, highlighting its potential role in driving oncogenic processes.

The patient had a history of hemimelia in the same limb as the congenital fibrosarcoma, but no known family history and no known prenatal exposures. Because the typical ETV6::NTRK3 fusion was not found, more extensive molecular profiling was done. A t(2;15)(p21;q24) translocation was identified by cytogenetics and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed clear copy-number transitions within EML4 and NTRK3. An EML4::NTRK3 (e2::e14) fusion was confirmed by RNA sequencing. This fusion was in-frame with breakpoints at exon 2 of EML4 and exon 14 of NTRK3. Stable lentiviral transduction of this fusion into NIH-3T3 cells induced soft agar colony growth in vitro and tumors in vivo. Based on similar positive cellular transformation and functional motifs to the typically found ETV6::NTRK3, the authors conclude other fusion partners like EML4::NTRK3 can contribute to the development of congenital fibrosarcoma.\n",

A novel NTRK3 break-apart probe set detected an NTRK3 rearrangement in 34/58 cases tested, including 25/26 infantile fibrosarcomas. In 46 cases tested, a novel EML4::NTRK3 dual fusion FISH probe set detected the fusion in 1 infantile fibrosarcoma case (case 58; 1 years old) known to harbor the EML4::NTRK3 fusion and a new case (case 3; 7 months), both with histology typical for what is observed in ETV6::NTRK3 infantile fibrosarcoma.

      "To establish the oncogenic role of the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion in various cancer types, additional evidence is needed in several areas. First, studies should investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the fusion protein contributes to oncogenesis across different tissue types, including its interaction with signaling pathways and transcription factors. Comparative studies across various cancer models could help identify common and unique phenotypic traits associated with the fusion. Additionally, clinical data correlating the presence of the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion with patient outcomes, treatment responses, and survival rates in diverse cancers would be valuable. Finally, functional studies, such as knockdown or inhibition experiments, could further elucidate the fusion's role in tumorigenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.\n",

Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",

Four clusters corresponded to known oncogenic subtypes, namely ZNF384, ERG/DUX4, BCR::ABL1-like, and KMT2A/MLL-rearranged. An additional cluster comprised 14 cases (8.2%), which lacked any fusion gene. Mutational analysis of RNA-seq data revealed the presence of a unique PAX5 mutation, c.239C>G, p.Pro80Arg (p.P80R), in all cases. In an additional cohort of 419 unselected BCP-ALL cases, PAX5 P80R was identified in 16 (5.3%). The authors conclude that the PAX5 P80R variant, with its distinct transcriptional signature, defines a subtype of BCP-ALL.\n",

Forty four cases (2.2%) showed the P80R substitution in the DNA binding domain for the PAX5 transcription factor gene. These cases were characterized by a unique expression profile. In the majority of the cases the mutation was hemizygous or homozygous, owing to deletion of the wild-type PAX5 allele or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. In 96% (42 of 44) of cases, the PAK5 P80R was accompanied by RAS and/or JAK-STAT signaling-pathway alterations (such as NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, NF1, IL7R), thereby suggesting cooperativity between deregulated PAX5 activity and kinase signaling.

The P80R cases had unique expression profile and did not have any other known key driver mutations. The P80R is proposed to define a specific molecular/genetic subtype of B-ALL.   .\n",

Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration.

In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response.

However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression.

This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.\n",

Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.  These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.\n",

The study included 13 tumors classified as pure SEF and six tumors from 4 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years. RNA-seq detected the EWSR1::CREB3L1 gene fusion in 8/13 pure SEF cases, with 2/13 positive for EWSR1::CREB3L2, and one each for FUS::CREM, FUS::CREB3L2, and PAX5::CREB3L1, while all hybrid tumors were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion.

A total of 18 cases included 10 cases of pure SEF and 8 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The overall mean age at diagnosis was 44 years (range 18–78). The pure SEF cases were found to have the well-known EWSR1::CREB3L1 fusion in 6/10 cases, a previously unidentified EWSR1::CREB3L2 fusion in 2/10 cases, a FUS rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10, and  an EWSR1 rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10 case.  On the other hand, the hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors all showed the presence of a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion.

Patients with SEF ranged from 28 to 91 years of age. Using RT-PCR, they detected in-frame fusions in 3/4 cases with suitable samples, joining either exon 7, 8, or 11 of EWSR1 to exon 6 of CREB3L1. Split signals at EWSR1 and CREB3L1 were detected by FISH in an additional case. All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement. The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: EGFR L858R has long been recognized as a functionally significant mutation in cancer, and is one of the most prevalent single mutations in lung cancer. Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.\n",

      "- ID 12017: In this 2011 study, the authors identified the genes involved in a reciprocal t(1;3)(p36;q25) translocation that had been detected in epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE) by karyotype. RNA isolated from an EHE with the known t(1;3)(p36;q25) translocation underwent whole-transcriptome sequencing and they detected a fusion that contained exon 2 of WWTR1 fused to exon 9 of CAMTA1. Using RT-PCR they confirmed the presence of the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in another 4 cases of t(1;3)(p36;q25) positive EHE. The fusion involved either exon 2 (type 1 fusion transcript) or exon 3 (type 2 fusion transcript) of WWTR1 in-frame to exon 9 of CAMTA1. To determine the incidence of WWTR1::CAMTA1 they performed FISH with break-apart probes that flanked the WWTR1 or CAMTA1 gene regions on 47 EHE samples. The analysis detected CAMTA1 rearrangement in 39 of 45 EHE tumors (87%) and 42 of 47 (89%) harbored a rearrangement of the WWTR1 gene region, while all other vascular tumors were negative. The authors conclude that the gene fusion is exclusively present in almost all EHEs, demonstrating it to be a disease-defining genetic alteration.\n",
      "- ID 1805: In this 2011 study, the authors investigated the genes involved in the t(1;3)(p36.3;q25) translocation associated with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) and its prevalence in a large spectrum of EHEs, including lesions from various anatomical locations and with differing malignant potential. The study included 17 EHE patients with a median age of 48 years (range 25–68). FISH analysis confirmed the translocation t(1;3)(1p36.23;3q25.1) in all EHE cases, and breakpoints were mapped to within WWTR1 and CAMTA1. Using RT-PCR they confirmed the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in the three tumors that had suitable tissue available. Exon 4 of WWTR1 was found to be fused to either exon 8 or exon 9 of CAMTA1. Of note, this fusion was not found in any other benign or malignant epithelioid vascular tumors examined, including 13 epithelioid hemangiomas, five epithelioid angiosarcomas, and four epithelioid sarcoma-like EHE. The authors conclude that t(1;3)(p36.23;q25.1) is a consistent genetic abnormality in EHEs of different anatomical locations and grades of malignancy.\n",
      "- ID 12019: In this 2014 study, the authors included a cohort of 39 cases of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) from different anatomical sites to investigate gene fusions by FISH and RT-PCR. The patients' ages ranged from 9 to 85 years. For the 35 samples they were able to test successfully, 33 were positive for WWTR1::CAMTA1 (94%) and 2 were positive for YAP1::TFE3 (6%). There were 8 cases with a detected fusion gene via RT-PCR that were negative with FISH testing, and 3 cases negative with RT-PCR that had a positive FISH result. Exon 4 of WWTR1 was fused to CAMTA1 exon 8 in 13 cases and exon 9 in 7 cases, and exon 3 of WWTR1 was fused to CAMTA1 exon 9 in 3 cases. The authors conclude that identification of the fusion in EHEs can provide important diagnostic information, especially in cases with aberrant morphology or limited biopsy material.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

Across the combined tRCC cohort, the majority of cases (88.6%) harbored TFE3 fusions with 12 different fusion partners identified.  ASPSCR1 (13), SFPQ (13), PRCC (13), NONO (5), MED15 (4), RBM10 (4) were recurrent partners while U2AF2, MATR3, LUC7L3, KHSRP, FUBP1, and DVL2 were each seen in 1 case.  All fusions analyzed preserve the helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper domain  of the TFE3 transcription factor, which is critical for dimerization and DNA binding.\n",

TFE3 immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing confirmed 22 of these (34%) were Xp11.2 RCC.  TFE3 rearrangements define RCCs with Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion, which, in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, further belongs to the category of \"MiT family translocation renal cell carcinoma.\" The MiT family (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor family) translocation RCC comprises of the Xp11 translocation RCC harboring TFE3 gene fusions and the t(6;11) renal cell carcinoma harboring TFEB gene fusion. This study showed that the Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion RCC can be difficult to diagnose by pathology, and that evaluation by FISH is a useful diagnostic tool for this tumor type.\n",
      "- ID 11683: A study of 443 renal cell carcinoma identified 7 cases with an Xp11 translocation. The median age of the 7 patients was 41 years (range, 15 to 59 years). Of the 244 cases with a successful karyotype, 4 were identified to have an Xp11 translocation. The fusion types of two cases were determined to be PSF::TFE3 and PRCC::TFE3. The other two cases were assumed to have the ASPSCR1::TFE3 gene fusion. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion in one cases was confirmed by RT-PCR. Likewise, the PRCC::TFE3 fusion was detected by RT-PCR and confirmed by direct sequencing. Of the 199 samples, for which the karyotype was not determined 3 cases were assumed Xp11 translocation by positive immunostaining for TFE3.\n",

(2016) included a total of 60 cases with known TFE3 gene rearrangements in this study of Xp11 translocation positive neoplasms (47 RCC, 8 PEComa, and 5 melanotic renal cancers). The age range for the RCC cases was 5 to 73 years. Fusion partners of TFE3 were identified using FISH (with confirmation by RNA sequencing in 5 cases) for 41/47 RCC cases, and included 7 SFPQ::TFE3 (PSF), 16 PRCC::TFE3, 12 ASPSCR1::TFE3 (ASPL), 5 NONO::TFE3, and 1 DVL2::TFE3. For the remaining 6 cases, the fusion partner of TFE3 was unable to be determined. The authors conclude that despite an identical gene fusion, the RCCs are distinct from the corresponding mesenchymal neoplasms and that the data can expand further the clinicopathologic features of cancers with specific TFE3 gene fusions.\n",

The patients ranged from 17 months to 17 years of age. RT-PCR performed on the extracted RNA identified the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion product in all eight cases. Seven of the cases contained the type 1 product, a fusion of ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 4, whereas one cases showed a type 2 product, a fusion of ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 3.   These cases were initially diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) but upon further analysis were recognized to contain similarities to ASPS, likely due to the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion suggesting they are a distinctive subset of RCC. Of note, ASPSCR1::TFE3 is referred to by the alternative name ASPL-TFE3 in this paper.\n",

(2005) included 7 renal neoplasms with cytogenetic and/or molecular evidence of the t(6;11)(p21;q12). The patients ranged from 9 to 33 years in age. All of the 7 renal neoplasms demonstrated either moderate or strong nuclear immunoreactivity for TFEB protein, and 1089 other neoplasms were tested but none showed significant labeling for TFEB. In 3 cases frozen tissue was available for RNA extraction, and RT-PCR detected the MALAT1(Alpha0::TFEB fusion. The potentially wide size range of MALAT1(Alpha)::TFEB fusion transcripts complicates the detection of this fusion by RT-PCR for robust detection in clinical RNA samples. The lack of splice signals in Alpha resulted in DNA PCR products of the same size as the RT-PCR products when the reverse primer binds to TFEB exon 3. The authors conclude that immunoreactivity for TFEB protein is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for these renal neoplasms and suggest that long-range DNA PCR may a useful alternative to RT-PCR due to the special molecular features of the Alpha::TFEB gene fusion.\n",

This 2012 study included 7 genetically confirmed cases of this rare tumor. The patients’ ages ranged from 21 to 37 years.  All of these tumors showed moderate to strong immunoreactivity for TFEB. DNA PCR performed on genomic DNA extracted from FFPE tissue samples of the tumor identified the Alpha::TFEB fusion gene in 2 cases.  The TFEB partner gene MALAT1 (Alpha) is an intronless, untranslated (non-protein coding) gene of unknown function. The Alpha::TFEB fusion genes were not identified in the other 5 cases. Using a FISH split probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs showed a high percentage of cells with separation signals, and using a fusion probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs demonstrated fusion signals. They concluded that the diagnosis of such tumors should be based not only on morphology itself but also on immunophenotype and molecular genetic findings.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

All patients diagnosed with de novo AML (337 children and 1,460 adults) or secondary AML (22 children and 119 adults) received comparable therapy. The study concluded that patients with different cytogenetic abnormalities can be divided into 3 prognostic subgroups with favorable, intermediate, and adverse outcomes solely based on the results of cytogenetics. AML with t(8;21) [which results in RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion] was grouped together with AML with inv(16) [CBFB::MYH11 fusion] and t(15;17) [PML::RARA fusion] in the favorable group. The 122 patients with AML with t(8;21) had a 98% CR (complete remission) rate and 2% induction deaths. The observed prognostic associations further support that these abnormalities define clinically and biologically distinct AML subtypes.\n",
      "- ID 11882: The authors of this 1997 paper compared morphologic and cytochemical features between 30 acute myeloid leukemia subtype M2 (AML-M2) patients with t(8;21)  and  50 AML-M2 patients without t(8;21). Morphologic characteristics highly enriched in cases positive for t(8;21) included irregular nuclear shape, Auer bodies, at least 90% myeloperoxidase positivity in blast cells, pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly of the nuclei, and homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils. These features were observed in 90-100% of the t(8;21) positive cases and were rare in the t(8;21) negative group. Homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils was the most characteristic of t(8;21)positive AML-M2, while pale-colored cytoplasm without any granules in mature neutrophils or dyserythropoietic features was never observed in association with t(8;21). The study suggests association of the t(8;21) with a subtype of AML that has morphologically recognizable features in a high proportion of cases.  Of note, AML with t(8;21) translocation is now known to result in a RUNX1::RUNX1T fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11878: In this 1992 study, the authors isolated a clone containing the junction region of the (8;21)(q22;q22) translocation characteristic for acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21). Using probes from the junction clone, the presence of this consistent junction region was confirmed in 9 independent cases of AML with t(8;21). The authors also isolated cDNA clones from a t(8;21) AML cDNA library that contained fused sequences from chromosomes 8 and 21. This allowed them to identify the chromosome 8 partner gene which they named ETO (currently known as RUNX1T1) and confirm the chromosome 21 partner as AML1 (currently RUNX1), which showed similarity with the Drosophila segmentation gene, runt. The consequence of the t(8;21) was determined to be the juxtaposition of 5' sequences of AML1 (RUNX1) to 3' sequences of ETO (RUNX1T1), oriented telomere to centromere on the der(8) chromosome. The study confirms that t(8;21) consistently results in an oncogenic fusion between specific partner genes, confirming its role as a defining oncogenic abnormality in a subtype of AML.\n",
      "- ID 11879: The researchers analyzed immunophenotype in 30 cases of newly diagnosed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibiting M2 morphology per French-American-British classification. They correlated these findings with cytogenetic data. In 16 out of the 30 cases, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation or its variants were detected. The leukemias harboring t(8;21) did not significantly vary from other M2 cases regarding expression of various cell surface markers like CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD36, CD41a, CD42b, CDw65, TdT, or HLA-DR. However, the B-cell antigen CD19 expression was observed in 81% of t(8;21) cases compared to only 7% of non-t(8;21) M2 cases. Moreover, 63% of t(8;21) cases exhibited the NK-cell antigen CD56 expression versus 14% of non-t(8;21) M2 leukemias. Coexpression of CD19 and CD56 was exclusively found in the t(8;21) group. This coexpression pattern was absent in 48 cases of other AML subtypes lacking t(8;21). Additionally, non-t(8;21) M2 cases frequently expressed CD2 or CD7, while none of the t(8;21) cases did. The authors deduced that t(8;21) defines a biologically unique pediatric M2 AML subgroup with distinct immunophenotypic features differentiating it from other de novo AML types.\n",

Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",
      "- ID 10362: In a further investigation of non-traditional sarcoma cases, a 41-year-old man was thought to have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in the neck and spinal cord, but large rhabdoid/epithelioid cell morphology and retained H3K27Me3. Metastatic lesions were found in the lung and spine. Pan-TRK immunostain was positive and RNA NGS detected a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion. The authors state this is the first report of a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion in a sarcoma, which seems to forecast high-grade morphology and behavior.\n",
      "- ID 10896: From a retrospective review of 38,095 tumor samples from 33,997 patients that underwent fusion screening at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 87 tumors were found to be positive for an NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusion. One positive patient with Glioblastoma Multiforme had an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 (e11::e14) fusion that was not detected by MSK-IMPACT, but was found with the RNA Archer screen. Detection of this fusion was positive in the cytoplasm by Pan-Trk immunohistochemical staining.\n",
      "- ID 8653: A case report showing a two-year-old girl with an unusual pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) with both classic- and anaplastic- appearing tumors. A custom NGS panel identified a novel KANK1-NTRK2 fusion in both the classic and anaplastic regions. The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.\n",
      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",

      "- ID 11424: Whole transcriptome sequencing on tumors from 8 patients with clear cell sarcoma of the kidney identified BCOR ITD and overexpression of BCOR in all samples.  The BCOR ITD was confirmed  on tumor DNA.  All samples showed numerous deleterious SNVs and InDels, but none were common among all samples.  BCOR ITD was the only common, recurrent alteration.\n",
      "- ID 10801: BCOR internal tandem duplications (ITDs) were found frequently in cases of clear cell sarcoma of kidney (CCSK), a rare pediatric renal cancer. The study initially evaluated 3 CCSK samples by whole exome sequencing and whole transcriptome sequencing. All 3 samples demonstrated BCOR ITD by RNA sequencing. This was further validated by targeted DNA sequencing of a validation institutional cohort of 11 primary and 2 matched metastatic CCSK cases, and an additional external cohort of 13 CCSK samples. Overall, BCOR ITDs were found in 85% (23/27 cases). No BCOR ITDs were found in neither matched normal kidney/blood, nor other childhood renal cancers. Upregulation of mutant BCOR transcripts and protein expression by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry was shown.\n",
      "- ID 10802: 27 cases of CCSK were profiled by whole exome sequencing and whole transcriptomics, identifying BCOR ITDs in the majority (23/27, 85%). BCOR  encodes a key constituent of a variant polycomb repressive complex (PRC). Similar to BCOR::CCNB3-related tumors, transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of PRC2-associated target genes including those associated with H3 K28 trimethylation. Disruption of polycomb repressive complex signaling likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of CCSK.\n",
      "- ID 11423: High BCOR expression which was associated with an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of 89 to 144 bp in exon 16 of the BCOR gene was identified in 20 of 20 (100%) of cases of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, but not in any of  the other 193 pediatric renal tumors tested.  This suggested that BCOR ITD may be useful in the diagnosis of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.\n",
      "- ID 7496: In this phase 1 dose-escalation study seventy patients with metastatic solid tumours were enrolled. Eight patient tumours were found to harbour NTRK gene fusions, six of which were ETV6-NTRK3. Treatment with larotrectinib resulted in reduced tumour burden for all patients with NTRK fusions. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 7993: Case report of a 61-year-old man with B-ALL. An initial analysis detected the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion and a NRASGly12Asp mutation. Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).\n",
      "- ID 8930: Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis of a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk) revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 8917: All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",
      "- ID 8931: The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 6099: Four out of six patients with infantile fibrosarcoma and a ETV6-NTRK3 fusion had a partial response, the remaining two had a complete response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",
      "- ID 11880: This study evaluated the independent prognostic significance of pretreatment cytogenetics based on the large Medical Research Council (MRC) AML 10 trial which enrolled a total of 1,966 patients (364 children and 1,602 adults). All patients diagnosed with de novo AML (337 children and 1,460 adults) or secondary AML (22 children and 119 adults) received comparable therapy. The study concluded that patients with different cytogenetic abnormalities can be divided into 3 prognostic subgroups with favorable, intermediate, and adverse outcomes solely based on the results of cytogenetics. AML with t(8;21) [which results in RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion] was grouped together with AML with inv(16) [CBFB::MYH11 fusion] and t(15;17) [PML::RARA fusion] in the favorable group. The 122 patients with AML with t(8;21) had a 98% CR (complete remission) rate and 2% induction deaths. The observed prognostic associations further support that these abnormalities define clinically and biologically distinct AML subtypes.\n",
      "- ID 11882: The authors of this 1997 paper compared morphologic and cytochemical features between 30 acute myeloid leukemia subtype M2 (AML-M2) patients with t(8;21)  and  50 AML-M2 patients without t(8;21). Morphologic characteristics highly enriched in cases positive for t(8;21) included irregular nuclear shape, Auer bodies, at least 90% myeloperoxidase positivity in blast cells, pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly of the nuclei, and homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils. These features were observed in 90-100% of the t(8;21) positive cases and were rare in the t(8;21) negative group. Homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils was the most characteristic of t(8;21)positive AML-M2, while pale-colored cytoplasm without any granules in mature neutrophils or dyserythropoietic features was never observed in association with t(8;21). The study suggests association of the t(8;21) with a subtype of AML that has morphologically recognizable features in a high proportion of cases.  Of note, AML with t(8;21) translocation is now known to result in a RUNX1::RUNX1T fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11878: In this 1992 study, the authors isolated a clone containing the junction region of the (8;21)(q22;q22) translocation characteristic for acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21). Using probes from the junction clone, the presence of this consistent junction region was confirmed in 9 independent cases of AML with t(8;21). The authors also isolated cDNA clones from a t(8;21) AML cDNA library that contained fused sequences from chromosomes 8 and 21. This allowed them to identify the chromosome 8 partner gene which they named ETO (currently known as RUNX1T1) and confirm the chromosome 21 partner as AML1 (currently RUNX1), which showed similarity with the Drosophila segmentation gene, runt. The consequence of the t(8;21) was determined to be the juxtaposition of 5' sequences of AML1 (RUNX1) to 3' sequences of ETO (RUNX1T1), oriented telomere to centromere on the der(8) chromosome. The study confirms that t(8;21) consistently results in an oncogenic fusion between specific partner genes, confirming its role as a defining oncogenic abnormality in a subtype of AML.\n",
      "- ID 11879: The researchers analyzed immunophenotype in 30 cases of newly diagnosed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibiting M2 morphology per French-American-British classification. They correlated these findings with cytogenetic data. In 16 out of the 30 cases, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation or its variants were detected. The leukemias harboring t(8;21) did not significantly vary from other M2 cases regarding expression of various cell surface markers like CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD36, CD41a, CD42b, CDw65, TdT, or HLA-DR. However, the B-cell antigen CD19 expression was observed in 81% of t(8;21) cases compared to only 7% of non-t(8;21) M2 cases. Moreover, 63% of t(8;21) cases exhibited the NK-cell antigen CD56 expression versus 14% of non-t(8;21) M2 leukemias. Coexpression of CD19 and CD56 was exclusively found in the t(8;21) group. This coexpression pattern was absent in 48 cases of other AML subtypes lacking t(8;21). Additionally, non-t(8;21) M2 cases frequently expressed CD2 or CD7, while none of the t(8;21) cases did. The authors deduced that t(8;21) defines a biologically unique pediatric M2 AML subgroup with distinct immunophenotypic features differentiating it from other de novo AML types.\n",

      "- ID 5682: This paper reports on 4 Chinese kindreds with VHL. The VHL gene was screened using direct DNA sequencing and MLPA in 44 volunteers among the 4 families. The above mutation was found in 1 kindred; 10 members were tested and 3 were found to harbour the mutation. The 7 members without a mutation were asymptomatic, while the 3 members with a mutation had manifestations. In addition to the 3 members who tested positive, there were 2 additional members who displayed manifestations, but died before testing could be performed. Clinical manifestations in this kindred included: renal cell carcinoma, CNS hemangioblastoma, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, and retinal hemangioblastoma. ACMG evidence codes: 'PP1' because of segregation results, 'PP4' because the patient's phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 5426: 43 unrelated VHL patients with previously sequenced VHL germline mutations and 36 suspected VHL mutation carriers were subject to denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) mutation screening. This mutation was found in 2  previously diagnosed VHL patients and a suspect VHL mutation carrier by DHPLC (family VHL 26, VHL 63, VHL 77). This variant results in an in frame deletion providing moderate evidence for pathogenicity (PM4).\n",
      "- ID 5203: In a study of 426 unrelated VHL patients, 111 were discovered to have alterations in the VHL gene. 18 novel variants were identified in VHL patients, but none were present in 200 unaffected control individuals. This deletion mutation was found in a 25 yr old VHL patient with multiple pancreatic cysts and hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system (index case 280). This study contains moderate support for pathogenicity because the protein length changes as a result changes as a result of in-frame deletions in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4).\n",
      "- ID 5766: Mutational analysis for 16 patients with clinically diagnosed VHL disease, revealed 12 germline mutations. This mutation was found in a 42-year-old VHL patient with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, renal cell carcinoma, and pancreatic cysts (proband no. 12). ACMG evidence codes: 'PP4' because the patient's phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 5750: This study reports 1,548 germline and somatic mutations from 945 VHL families. Mutation was detected in a VHL kindred with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, retinal hemangioblastomas and Grawitz tumor (also known as RCC) (case no. 2034). Protein length changes as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4). Patient's phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology (ACMG code: PP4).\n",
      "- ID 5340: Blood samples from 5 Japanese families revealed 4 germline mutations. This mutation was found in a family of 3 individuals (Family B). Only one patient in this family developed symtoms, which included a brain stem hemangioblastoma and retinal angioma discovered at age 30. Parents of this individual showed no manifestations of VHL disease and were negative for bands via single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis where the proband showed extra bands. This study contains moderate evidence of pathogenicity because the protein length changes as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4).\n",
      "- ID 6557: A prospective study followed 128 participants affected by VHL syndrome for 12 years in Padova, Italy. Individual patient data was not available, but frequency of specific mutations was presented. An in-frame deletion (TCT) at nucleotide 227 was present in 1 individual of the 122 total number of variants captured in this population.\n",
      "- ID 5386: A previous study of 26 Japanese, VHL families was extended to 41 additional families. Germline mutations were detected in 55 of 77 Japanese families. Renal cell carcinoma occurred predominantly in non-missense mutations predicted to lead to gross alteration or complete loss of the VHL protein. This mutation was found in a VHL type 1 patient with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, pancreatic cyst or tumor, and renal cell carcinoma (family ID 80).\n",
      "- ID 6121: Molecular analysis of VHL gene in 146 probands, 103 with and 43 without a positive family history, resulted in the detection of 43 germline VHL mutations. Majority of mutations were found in patients with classic or multi-organ manifestations of VHL disease, but mutations were also found in patients with limited or single-organ manifestations of VHL disease. Follow-up of families with germline mutations and limited VHL manifestations was recommended. This in-frame deletion variant was detected in a VHL type 2 patient with cerebellar hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, and epididymal cysts (family no. 24).\n",
      "- ID 5744: Genotype-phenotype correlations of 573 VHL patients were analyzed and confirmed that higher risk of pheochromocytoma is associated with missense mutations that result in substitution of a surface amino acid or that disrupt the structural integrity of the VHL gene product (pVHL). Age-related risks of retinal angiomas and renal cell carcinoma were higher in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations. This mutation was found in 4 unrelated families of 8 individuals total. 5 individuals had retinal hemangioblastomas, 4 had hemangioblastomas of the cerebellum, and 3 had renal cell carcinoma. ACMG evidence codes: 'PM4' because they observe a protein length change as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region or stop-loss variants, 'PP4' because the patients' phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 5641: An investigation of 94 VHL patients without large deletions for intragenic mutations revealed 40 different mutations in 55 unrelated individuals. In all patients with multiple affected family members the missense mutation segregated with the disease. This mutation was found in 2 VHL type 1 patients (kindred no. 48, 75). Only moderate support for pathogenicity because protein length changes as a result of in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4).\n",
      "- ID 5749: Molecular analysis of VHL gene in 146 probands, 103 with and 43 without a positive family history, resulted in the detection of 43 germline VHL mutations. Majority of mutations were found in patients with classic or multi-organ manifestations of VHL disease, but mutations were also found in patients with limited or single-organ manifestations of VHL disease. Follow-up of families with germline mutations and limited VHL manifestations was recommended. This mutation was found in 2 family members with retinal hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinoma (family no. 25). One family member also had central nervous system hemangioblastoma. ACMG evidence codes: 'PM4' because they observe a protein length change as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region.\n",
      "- ID 6862: Medical records of 26 patients diagnosed with VHL disease in two Korean hospitals between 2003-2012 and harboring germline VHL mutations were retrospectively reviewed. One male patient diagnosed with Type 1 VHL disease at 23Y (Patient 14) presented with renal cell carcinoma, multiple CNS hemangioblastomas and other manifestations. He had a germline inframe deletion in the VHL gene (c.227delTCT) and a negative family history of VHL disease.\n",
      "- ID 11780: Histological, molecular, and clinical analysis of 26 histologically prototypical isomorphic diffuse gliomas with a specific DNA methylation profile distinct from other glial/glio-neuronal brain tumors and normal hemispheric tissue were found to be most closely related to pediatric MYB/MYBL1-altered diffuse astrocytomas and angiocentric gliomas. IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Nine tumors had MYBL1 rearrangements (including one involving 5’ of MYBL1) with various gene partners, including MMP16 (n=3), RAD51B (n=1), MAML2 (n=1), ZFHX4 (n=1), TOX (n=1), RP11-586K2.1 (intergenic region) (n=1), and RP11492M23.2 (intergenic region) (n=1). These fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain of MYBL1.  Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYBL1 in 10 tumors, including six with MYBL1 fusion and four without MYBL1 fusions detected. Increased MYBL1 expression was observed in 71% (10/14) of the tumors with MYBL1 alterations.\n",
      "- ID 11779: Comprehensive molecular studies (through whole genome, whole exome, transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide copy number analysis, clustering analysis by DNA methylation profiling, mutation hotspot analysis by Sanger sequencing, and FISH) were performed in a cohort of 91 low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs), including diffuse astrocytomas, angiocentric gliomas, gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas. Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and no IDH mutations were detected in these tumors. MYB (n=5) or MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangements were detected in 41% (7/17) of diffuse astrocytomas, while the remaining tumors had alternations involving BRAF (n = 4), FGFR1/3 (n = 4), and others (n = 2). The gene partners involving MYB fusions in diffuse astrocytomas included PCDHGA1, LOC154902, and MMP16, and the gene partners involving MYBL1 included MMP16. In contrast, a MYB fusion (most frequently MYB::QKI) characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (14 of 15). Only one other tumor across the series (an oligodendroglioma) had a MYB fusion (MYB::MAML2). MYB/MYBL-altered LGNTs clustered together with methylation profiling. The findings in LGNT with a predominantly astrocytic phenotype associating with MYB/MYBL alterations suggest a role of MYB/MYBL in these tumor categories with distinct characteristics.\n",
      "- ID 11781: Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2). All five DA2 samples with 8q focal gains exhibited a common centromeric breakpoint within MYBL1 after exon 9, resulting in partial duplication of MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged DA2 demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication with the telomeric sequence located in MMP16. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional DA2s with MYBL1 partial duplication. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas (AGs) in the related gene MYB on 6q23.3. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n",
      "- ID 9588: One patient was identified with a LMNA-NTRK1 positive tumor in this Phase I study (NCT02122913), which involved 70 heavily pretreated patients with a median age of 59.5 years, with multiple solid tumor types. A total of eight patients had NTRK fusions, and by independent radiology review, all patients with TRK fusion were considered to have had an objective response. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion. Authors concluded that NTRK fusions may represent tissue and age agnostic oncogenic drivers, and that Larotrectinib was well tolerated in the patients and demonstrated activity in all tumors with NTRK fusions.\n",
      "- ID 11576: A 31-year-old female presented with a pigmented nodule on her scalp that enlarged in size over a 2-year period. Biopsy demonstrated a fascicular proliferation of bland spindle cells within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and was found in adipose tissue in a “honeycomb pattern.” Immunohistochemical staining revealed the spindle cells were positive for CD34 and S-100 protein and were negative for SOX10. FISH was negative for PDGFB rearrangement. The spindle cells were positive for pan-NTRK by IHC and targeted RNA sequencing revealed the LMNA::NTRK1 e2::e10 fusion. The patient’s tumor was completely excised, and no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease was found at 24-month follow-up. The authors indicate the tumor analyses demonstrate a diagnosis of a NTRK-rearranged LPF-NT with unusual histopathological findings that include lymphoid aggregates and pigmented dendritic melanocytes.\n",
      "- ID 11577: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion. Biopsy revealed a spindle cell mesenchymal tumor with monotonous, bland spindle cells mixed with fat and blood vessels. IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Due to the unusual tumor location, an anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel was used and detected a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. The author’s reclassified their diagnosis to an S-100 positive LPF-NT of the spine based on the identification of the fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11578: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion.  IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel revealed a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) fusion that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. Surgical resection was not an option due to tumor size and location. The patient was enrolled into a phase II trial and treated with 600mg of entrectinib daily. After 1 month, the mass showed near-complete loss of enhancement and density (Hounsfield units dropped from 200 to 55-60). At week 12, response plateau was reached with the lesion reducing by 45% (RECIST 1.1). Due to the exceptional response, vertebrectomy was possible and completed. The patient continued entrectinib and has been recurrence free for 7 months.\n",
      "- ID 11650: A 3-year-old girl presented with spots on her right buttock that evolved into lumps. Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse subcutaneous tissue thickening without significant involvement of underlying soft tissue. Punch biopsy demonstrated small whorls and fascicles of bland spindled cells with no mitotic activity, atypical mitotic figures, or nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical staining resulted in CD34 positivity in the lesional cells, negative S100-protein in the spindle cells, and positive Pan-Trk staining in the spindled-cells. Transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) revealed the presence of an in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 fusion (exon4::exon10) that includes the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. According to the authors, this case presents grounds to use pan-Trk staining to determine the diagnosis of LPF versus LPF-NT S100 detection can vary in rare instances.\n",
      "- ID 11354: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, the entrectinib retained activity against both the wild type and the NTRK1 F589L gatekeeper mutation with IC50s of 0.30 +/- 0.1 and <0.2 nM respectively.\n",
      "- ID 11349: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, the first generation inhibitor larotrectinib was 28-150 fold less active against fusions with mutations in the NTRK1 kinase domain.  The IC50 for LMNA:NTRK1 with no mutation was 23.5 nM while the IC50s for the LMNA:NTRK1 fusion with G595R (solvent front), F589L (gatekeeper), or G667C (xDFG) mutation were 3540, 675, and 1630 nM respectively.\n",
      "- ID 11346: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, repotrectinib retained the greatest activity against fusions with mutations in the NTRK1 kinase domain.  The Ba/F3 proliferation IC50 for LMNA:NTRK1 with no mutation was <0.2 nM while the IC50s for the LMNA:NTRK1 fusion with G595R (solvent front), F589L (gatekeeper), G667C (xDFG), or G595R+F589L were 0.2, <0.2, 11.8, and 17.7 respectively. Repotrectinib also inhibited autophosphorylation of LMNA:NTRK1 in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the construct at low concentrations.\n",
      "- ID 10095: BaF3 cells were transduced with a number of NTRK fusions. IC50 values were measured following treatment with entrectinib: TPM3-NTRK1 (2.5nM), LMNA-NTRK1 (1.4nM), ETV6-NTRK1 (2.5nM), VCL-NTRK2 (4.3nM), AFAP1-NTRK2 (2.7nM), ETV6-NTRK2 (4.5nM), ETV6-NTRK3 (3.8nM), and control (>1000nM).\n",
      "- ID 8901: FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft of a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 10 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Expression was confirmed by Western and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. Western blot of the tumor also indicated constitutive activation of the fusion based on phosphorylation of the fusion. Additionally, downstream kinase targets (PLCγ1, AKT, and MAPK) were also phosphorylated in the tumor, similar to levels observed in the TPM3-NTRK1 containing KM12 colorectal cancer cell line.\n",
      "- ID 8900: After disease progression with no objective response to therapy, a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver displayed elevated NTRK1 expression in both primary tumor and liver metastasis as measured by immunohistochemistry. FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 11 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Fusion expression of both transcripts was confirmed by western blot, and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. After 4 weeks of treatment with Entrectinib, CT scan revealed the patient showed a partial response with a 30% reduction of target lesions. This response was maintained for 5 months.\n",
      "- ID 2955: LOXO-101 is an orally administered inhibitor of the TRK kinase and is highly selective only for the TRK family of receptors. The tumor of a 41-year-old woman with soft-tissue sarcoma metastatic to the lung was found to harbor an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 (exon 2 & exon 11) gene fusion encoding a functional LMNA-TRKA fusion oncoprotein. This patient's tumors underwent rapid and substantial tumor regression, with an accompanying improvement in pulmonary dyspnea, oxygen saturation, and plasma tumor markers.\n",
      "- ID 2960: A gene fusion between exon 11 of LMNA and exon 10 of NTRK1 was observed in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer after therapy with first-line FOLFOX, second-line FOLFIRI/cetuximab, and third-line irinotecan. The patient treated in a clinical trial with pan-TRK kinase inhibitor entrectinib. Treatment was well tolerated and led to a partial response (PR) with 30% tumor shrinkage of multiple liver metastases. Clinical response lasted 4 months.\n",
      "- ID 6100: One Patient with soft tissue sarcoma and a NTRK1-LMNA fusion had a partial response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",
      "- ID 6391: A 14-month-old boy presented with a slow-growing, asymptomatic back plaque, which was biopsied and found to have S100 positivity, sparse CD34 staining, and no significant mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism, or necrosis. IHC detected cytoplasmic expression of NTRK1 and FISH detected the LMNA::NTRK1 fusion. Based on these findings the authors conclude this is patient has a lipofibromatosis-like neural tumor (LPF-NT). The patient was treated with wide local excision and has developed no complications or evidence of recurrence with 6 months of follow-up time. LPF-NT is rare, with 14 cases previously reported, and this patient was the first report of this diagnosis in infancy.\n",
      "- ID 8878: A mass found at birth in a patient’s left arm became enlarged at age 2 and was resected and characterized as a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma. FISH and RT-PCR did not detect any common sarcoma translocations. A recurrence and a new mass formed after 4 months of therapy, so amputation was performed. Metastatic high-grade sarcoma appeared in the lungs 4 months later followed by multiple recurrences 10 months after treatment. Whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of diagnosis and normal samples were performed and the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact was discovered. Treatment with Crizotinib was started and a chest CT after 2 months revealed partial response. After 22 months of therapy, chest CT revealed a complete response of lung nodules, which has been sustained >18 months beyond the conclusion of treatment at 31 months.\n",
      "- ID 8902: A 40-year-old patient with a left calf mass revealed by biopsy to be a low grade myxoid spindle cell carcinoma underwent surgery and radiotherapy. Over a 5-year period, the patient experienced 3 lung metastases, which were all resected. At year 6, unresectable metastases were found in the lungs and lymph nodes. FISH and targeted next generation RNA sequencing of an earlier lung metastasis revealed and confirmed an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact. TRK inhibitor was administered and PET-CT scan revealed near complete response and no new lesions 1 year later.\n",
      "- ID 8903: The in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 11) with intact kinase domain was found and confirmed by next generation sequencing, RT-PCR, FISH, and/or immunohistochemistry in 3 Spitz neoplasm cases. Compared to controls (wildtype NTRK1 overexpression and GFP), lentiviral mediated overexpression of LMNA-NTRK1 in mouse melanocyte cells (melan-a) displayed increased phosphorylation of the fusion and downstream kinase targets, as assessed by Western Blot. Treatment with the NTRK1 inhibitor, AZ-23, quenched fusion and pathway activation. Additionally, injection of LMNA-NTRK1 melan-a cells into immunocompromised mice resulted in the rapid growth of tumors at the injection site within 40 days. Similar results were observed in mice injected with melan-a cells overexpressing NRAS G12V or HRAS G12V, but no tumors were observed in mice injected with GFP control melan-a cells.\n",
      "- ID 8904: A total of 140 Spitzoid neoplasm cases were analyzed by FISH and/or targeted DNA and RNA sequencing (n=38). Mutually exclusive kinase fusions were found in 72 cases. NTRK1 fusions were observed in 23 cases (8/75 Spitz naevi; 8/32 atypical Spitz tumors; 7/33 Spitzoid melanomas) and their expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. NTRK1 expression was absent in cases without a NTRK1 rearrangement. A 743kb deletion leading to the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 11) with the kinase domain intact was found in 3/38 NGS analyzed cases (1 nevus, 1 atypical, 1Spitzoid) and was verified by RT-PCR.\n",

      "- ID 11780: Histological, molecular, and clinical analysis of 26 histologically prototypical isomorphic diffuse gliomas with a specific DNA methylation profile distinct from other glial/glio-neuronal brain tumors and normal hemispheric tissue were found to be most closely related to pediatric MYB/MYBL1-altered diffuse astrocytomas and angiocentric gliomas. IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Nine tumors had MYBL1 rearrangements (including one involving 5’ of MYBL1) with various gene partners, including MMP16 (n=3), RAD51B (n=1), MAML2 (n=1), ZFHX4 (n=1), TOX (n=1), RP11-586K2.1 (intergenic region) (n=1), and RP11492M23.2 (intergenic region) (n=1). These fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain of MYBL1.  Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYBL1 in 10 tumors, including six with MYBL1 fusion and four without MYBL1 fusions detected. Increased MYBL1 expression was observed in 71% (10/14) of the tumors with MYBL1 alterations.\n",
      "- ID 11779: Comprehensive molecular studies (through whole genome, whole exome, transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide copy number analysis, clustering analysis by DNA methylation profiling, mutation hotspot analysis by Sanger sequencing, and FISH) were performed in a cohort of 91 low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs), including diffuse astrocytomas, angiocentric gliomas, gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas. Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and no IDH mutations were detected in these tumors. MYB (n=5) or MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangements were detected in 41% (7/17) of diffuse astrocytomas, while the remaining tumors had alternations involving BRAF (n = 4), FGFR1/3 (n = 4), and others (n = 2). The gene partners involving MYB fusions in diffuse astrocytomas included PCDHGA1, LOC154902, and MMP16, and the gene partners involving MYBL1 included MMP16. In contrast, a MYB fusion (most frequently MYB::QKI) characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (14 of 15). Only one other tumor across the series (an oligodendroglioma) had a MYB fusion (MYB::MAML2). MYB/MYBL-altered LGNTs clustered together with methylation profiling. The findings in LGNT with a predominantly astrocytic phenotype associating with MYB/MYBL alterations suggest a role of MYB/MYBL in these tumor categories with distinct characteristics.\n",
      "- ID 11781: Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2). All five DA2 samples with 8q focal gains exhibited a common centromeric breakpoint within MYBL1 after exon 9, resulting in partial duplication of MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged DA2 demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication with the telomeric sequence located in MMP16. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional DA2s with MYBL1 partial duplication. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas (AGs) in the related gene MYB on 6q23.3. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n",
      "- ID 7008: A HEY1-NCOA2 fusion joining exon 4 of HEY1 to exon 13 of NCOA2 was identified in 10 mesenchymal chondrosarcomas but was absent from all other sarcoma types tested including other chondrosarcoma subtypes suggesting this fusion is diagnostic for mesenchymal chondrosarcomas.\n",
      "- ID 7125: Meningeal hemangiopericytoma (HPC) and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (MC) are aggressive neoplasms with overlapping clinical presentations and morphology. Thirteen FFPE samples of MC (9 females, 4 males) from ages 19 to 54 and Eighteen cases of meningeal HPC (8 females, 10 males) from ages from 24 to 73 years were tested using RT-PCR for the presence of HEY1-NCOA2 fusion. Of cases with evaluable RNA, 6/6 MC cases were positive for the fusion, but 0/11 meningeal HPC cases were fusion positive.\n",
      "- ID 7124: FISH was used to detect HEY1-NCOA2 fusions in 10 paraffin embedded samples from patients diagnosed with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. HEY1 and NCOA2 are located on the same chromosome but generate distinct FISH signals, whereas the HEY1-NCOA2 fusion appears as a single fused dot. Specimens were considered positive for fusion when FISH showed overlapping signals of HEY1 and NCOA2 in greater than 20% of the cells. Overlap signal of over 20% was seen in 8/10 patients. The two patients with no overlap signal were also negative for FISH staining, suggesting insufficient or damaged material for FISH.\n",
      "- ID 7017: 6 of 6 patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma and sufficient tissue tested positive for NCOA2 rearrangments by FISH supporting that NCOA2 rearrangements (presumably HEY1-NCOA2 translocations) are prevalent in this disease.\n",
      "- ID 11519: RNA-seq transcriptome analysis in a discovery cohort of 170 B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL)  cases negative for the common classifying cytogenetic aberrations identified several well-defined hierarchical expression clusters. Four clusters corresponded to known oncogenic subtypes, namely ZNF384, ERG/DUX4, BCR::ABL1-like, and KMT2A/MLL-rearranged. An additional cluster comprised 14 cases (8.2%), which lacked any fusion gene. Mutational analysis of RNA-seq data revealed the presence of a unique PAX5 mutation, c.239C>G, p.Pro80Arg (p.P80R), in all cases. In an additional cohort of 419 unselected BCP-ALL cases, PAX5 P80R was identified in 16 (5.3%). The authors conclude that the PAX5 P80R variant, with its distinct transcriptional signature, defines a subtype of BCP-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 7291: Integrated genomic analysis was performed for 1,988 childhood and adult B-ALL cases. Forty four cases (2.2%) showed the P80R substitution in the DNA binding domain for the PAX5 transcription factor gene. These cases were characterized by a unique expression profile. In the majority of the cases the mutation was hemizygous or homozygous, owing to deletion of the wild-type PAX5 allele or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. In 96% (42 of 44) of cases, the PAK5 P80R was accompanied by RAS and/or JAK-STAT signaling-pathway alterations (such as NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, NF1, IL7R), thereby suggesting cooperativity between deregulated PAX5 activity and kinase signaling.  The PAX5 P80R is proposed to define a distinct subtype of B-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 7290: In a large-scale international study RNA sequencing was performed to delineate the transcriptome landscape of 1,223 B-cell ALL cases. Twenty two cases were found to have P80R misense mutation in the DNA-binding domain of the PAX5 transcription factor gene. The P80R cases had unique expression profile and did not have any other known key driver mutations. The P80R is proposed to define a specific molecular/genetic subtype of B-ALL.   .\n",

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\n",

All cases were confirmed by molecular testing to harbor YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions, 88% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 4 and 12% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 6. While conventional WWTR1::CAMTA1 EHE is characterized by relatively uniform morphology, YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma exhibits remarkable inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity with distinctive morphologic features not seen in conventional EHE. A striking clinical characteristic of YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma was that large proportion of patients survive many years with stable disease despite having multifocal disease and distant metastasis. The authors propose categorizing YAP1::TFE3 epithelioid hemangioendothelioma as a distinct disease entity from conventional epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (which typically harbors WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusions) due to its clinical and histopathologic characteristics.\n",
      "- ID 11537: This 2023 study included 29 epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) cases, with the median patient age of 53 years. Eleven of the 29 tumors had a targeted sequencing panel which identified the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in 9 (81%) patients and the YAP1::TFE3 fusion in 2 (19%) patients.  The authors state that no single specific morphological feature was defining EHE but a constellation of features and the molecular studies could provide assurance of the diagnosis.\n",
      "- ID 11536: This study by Antonescu, et al. (2013) included 10 cases with a diagnosis of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), which showed unusual morphologic features such as abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, mature vascular channel formation and were negative for WWTR1 and CAMTA1 rearrangements by FISH. Patients ranged in age from 14 to 50 years. RNA sequencing identified a YAP1::TFE3 fusion transcript, and RT-PCR confirmed the fusion transcript of YAP1 exon 1 to exon 4 of TFE3. All 10 cases investigated by FISH showed TFE3 break-apart signal, and 8 of the 10 also showed YAP1 rearrangement.  A control group of similar tumor types which included 18 epithelioid hemangiomas, 9 pseudomyogenic HE, and 3 epithelioid angiosarcomas showed no TFE3 rearrangements suggesting the YAP1::TFE3 is specific for this subgroup of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.\n",
      "- ID 11538: This 2021 paper by Dermawan, et al. included 24 cases of YAP1::TFE3 fusion-positive epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas (EHE), with an age range of 20 to 78 years old. All cases were confirmed by molecular testing to harbor YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions, 88% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 4 and 12% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 6. The predicted fusion protein contains the TEAD binding site of YAP1 (located in exon 1), which is essential for tethering the protein to genes to activate transcription, and swaps the YAP1 transactivating domain for the basic helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains of TFE3. Thus the fusion protein acts as a transcription factor that utilizes the transactivating domains and nuclear localization sequences of TFE3 and binds DNA through the TEAD binding site on YAP1, resulting in a constitutively active chimeric transcription factor. YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) are highly homologous transcriptional co-regulators that are downstream nuclear effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway. In EHE with WWTR1::CAMTA1 gene fusion, WWTR1::CAMTA1 acts as a constitutively active form of TAZ. Thus the a YAP-like transcriptional program in YAP1::TFE3 fused EHE, is considered analogous to WWTR1::CAMTA1 EHE (PMID: 33913810).\n",

      "- ID 11782: In this 2012 study O’Meara et al. included 51 clear cell sarcoma of kidney (CCSK). Using an index CCSK with the t(10;17)(q22;p13) identified by cytogenetics, they were able to map the breakpoints and identified the gene fusion transcript YHWAE::FAM22, currently known as YHWAE::NUTM2. Using RT-PCR they screened an additional 50 samples. Overall, fusion positive transcripts of YHWAE::NUTM2 were detected in 7/51 (14%) cases. Ages of the patients ranged from 0 to 6 years. This rearrangement produces an in-frame YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript, comprising exons 1–5 of YWHAE and exons 2–7 of NUTM2. Of the 3 cases with RNA sufficient to sequence the entire coding region, the YWHAE fusion partner was identified as either NUTM2B (FAM22B) or NUTM2E (FAM22E). None of the transcript-positive cases presented with stage I disease, suggesting the fusion may be associated with poorer outcome. Tumor cellularity was significantly higher in the cases that were transcript-positive.\n",
      "- ID 11783: In this 2020 study Kenny et al. included 68 cases of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). Using RT-PCR with RNA extracted from FFPE  tumour tissue they detected a YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript in 1/68 (1.5%) of cases. The majority of cases (54/68, 79%) had a BCOR ITD which is mutually exclusive with the YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion. The group generated a cell line model system in which inducible expression of YWHAE::NUTM2 could be used to identify reliable immunohistochemical markers. The study concluded that reliance on a single marker in CCSK is not ideal and suggested BCOR, TLE1 and CCND1 could be useful as a group of markers, with the YWHAE::NUTM2 case as well as BCOR-ITD cases staining strongly for all three of these markers, while  63 control samples from tumor types often considered in the differential diagnosis were negative or weakly staining.\n",
      "- ID 11784: In this 2016 study Kenny et al. included 159 cases of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). RNA was extracted from either snap-frozen or FFPE tumour tissue samples and real-time PCR used to identify YWHAE::NUTM2 fusions. Of the 102 cases tested, 2 (2%) were positive for the YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript. The two cases were both aged less than a year (mean of 9 months), both male, and disease stage II or III/IV.  The YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript is present in only a minority of CCSKs, however the observation of the same rearrangement in high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, suggests this translocation is oncogenic.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop.

      "- ID 1273: In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.\n",
      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",
      "- ID 1279: In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.\n",
      "- ID 8657: A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).\n",
      "- ID 11603: An analysis of 85 small blue round cell tumors (SBRCTs) that were negative for EWSR1, CIC, or BCOR by FISH identified 6 FUS::ERG and 1 FUS::FEV fusions.  Clinicopathologic characterization of these 7 cases with FUS fusions and 8 FUS-rearranged SBRCTs reported in the literature described the morphology as monomorphic round cell cytomorphology (keeping with a classic Ewing sarcoma phenotype) with diffuse membranous CD99 reactivity in all except one case with patchy staining.  Of note, there were 4 patients in this group who had scored negative for EWSR1 FISH that were positive for EWSR1::ERG  by other means (FusionSeq, RT-PCR, etc.) and the authors caution of the false negatives with EWSR1 FISH due to the complexity of the the EWSR1::ERG rearrangement.  The authors conclude that these rarer alternative fusions also lead to classic Ewing sarcoma.\n",
      "- ID 475: The t(21;22) rearrangement resulting in the EWSR1::ERG fusion is associated with the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma. EWSR1::ERG is the second most common gene fusion reported in this disease.\n",
      "- ID 10338: Molecular analysis of 30 Ewing tumors (designated as Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) in this 1994 paper) from patients with well-documented clinical course was performed.   RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28).  Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses.   The two tumors with EWSR1::ERG had breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG with a t(2;22) rearrangement detected in 1 of these 2 cases by karyotyping.  Authors conclude RT-PCR is a sensitive method for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors.\n",

      "- ID 11581: Six cases of CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor (HGNET) with BCOR exon 15 internal tandem duplication (ITD) were studied. The authors analyzed their clinical, pathologic and molecular characteristic and compared them with Clear Cell Sarcoma of Kidney (CCSK) and soft tissue sarcoma with the same genetic abnormality (BCOR ex15 ITD). Cases of CNS HGNET with BCOR ex15 ITD were histologically characterized by glial cell morphology, ependymoma-like perivascular pseudorosettes and palisading necrosis. Immunohistochemically, they showed diffuse staining of Olig2, and focal staining of GFAP, S-100 protein and synaptophysin. Clinically, histologically and immunohistochemically CNS  HG NETs with BCOR ex15 ITD were distinct from CCSK and soft tissue sarcomas with BCOR ex15 ITD, supporting that these should be considered a unique type of CNS tumor.\n",
      "- ID 10800: The authors generated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of 323 tumors with an institutional diagnosis of ‘primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-PNETs)’,  which  are highly aggressive, poorly differentiated embryonal tumors occurring predominantly in young children but also affecting adolescents and adults. Four novel methylation profiles were identified. One of those profiles was exhibited by 10/323 (3 %) cases,  and all these tumors were found to have a duplicated region in exon 15 of BCOR [BCOR internal tandem duplication (ITD)] by DNA/RNA sequencing, identical to that of the BCOR ITD in other tumor types including clear cell sarcomas of the kidney, undifferentiated round cell sarcomas in infants, and primitive myxoid mesenchymal tumour of infancy. The authors compared DNA methylation pattern of the BCOR-ITD positive cases with an in-house collection of > 10,000 methylation profiles from a broad variety of pediatric and adult CNS tumors. Additional tumors with variety of histologies showed the same methylation profile as BCOR-ITD positive cases, and were also found to have BCOR-ITD. The authors proposed that BCOR-ITD defines a specific molecular subtype of  CNS tumors.\n",
      "- ID 10887: 10 cases of high-grade neuroepithelial tumor  (HGNET) with BCOR exon 15 ITD were studied. In addition, 25 previously reported and published patients were included in survival analyses. These tumors are newly proposed to belong to a separate entity with a distinct methylation profile and a characteristic genetic alteration. The authors further describe  their clinical, pathologic, radiographic, and genetic features. Shared histologic characteristics included predominantly solid growth, glioma‐like fibrillarity, perivascular pseudorosettes, and palisading necrosis, but absence of microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemistry testing showed absent GFAP expression, no synaptophysin expression, variable OLIG2 and NeuN positivity, and diffuse strong BCOR nuclear positivity. In 6 of 10 cases, BCOR ex15 ITD was the only pathogenic alteration seen, while other cases showed additional genetic abnormalities including CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, TERT amplification or promoter hotspot mutation, and damaging mutations in TP53, BCORL1, EP300, SMARCA2 and STAG2. The authors conclude that their findings further support inclusion of HG NET with BCOR ex15 ITD as a distinct CNS tumor entity.\n",
      "- ID 10804: 10/323 studied high-grade primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-HGPNETs)  clustered together based on their unique methylation profile. 10/10 of those tumors exhibited in-frame internal tandem duplications in the BCOR gene. The duplicated region was identical with that of the BCOR ITDs described in clear cell sarcoma of the kidney. 1 additional tumor harbored a BCOR intragenic in-frame deletion, and two additional tumors had BCOR frameshift mutations. Gene expression of BCOR was higher in CNS HG PNET BCOR-ITD positive tumors than in other CNS tumor types, suggesting different mechanism from BCOR loss-of-function mutations reported in other malignancies,. The results are consistent with BCOR-ITDs acting as primary oncogenic drivers in a unique type of CNS HG PNETs.\n",
      "- ID 11780: Histological, molecular, and clinical analysis of 26 histologically prototypical isomorphic diffuse gliomas with a specific DNA methylation profile distinct from other glial/glio-neuronal brain tumors and normal hemispheric tissue were found to be most closely related to pediatric MYB/MYBL1-altered diffuse astrocytomas and angiocentric gliomas. IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Nine tumors had MYBL1 rearrangements (including one involving 5’ of MYBL1) with various gene partners, including MMP16 (n=3), RAD51B (n=1), MAML2 (n=1), ZFHX4 (n=1), TOX (n=1), RP11-586K2.1 (intergenic region) (n=1), and RP11492M23.2 (intergenic region) (n=1). These fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain of MYBL1.  Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYBL1 in 10 tumors, including six with MYBL1 fusion and four without MYBL1 fusions detected. Increased MYBL1 expression was observed in 71% (10/14) of the tumors with MYBL1 alterations.\n",
      "- ID 11779: Comprehensive molecular studies (through whole genome, whole exome, transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide copy number analysis, clustering analysis by DNA methylation profiling, mutation hotspot analysis by Sanger sequencing, and FISH) were performed in a cohort of 91 low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs), including diffuse astrocytomas, angiocentric gliomas, gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas. Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and no IDH mutations were detected in these tumors. MYB (n=5) or MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangements were detected in 41% (7/17) of diffuse astrocytomas, while the remaining tumors had alternations involving BRAF (n = 4), FGFR1/3 (n = 4), and others (n = 2). The gene partners involving MYB fusions in diffuse astrocytomas included PCDHGA1, LOC154902, and MMP16, and the gene partners involving MYBL1 included MMP16. In contrast, a MYB fusion (most frequently MYB::QKI) characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (14 of 15). Only one other tumor across the series (an oligodendroglioma) had a MYB fusion (MYB::MAML2). MYB/MYBL-altered LGNTs clustered together with methylation profiling. The findings in LGNT with a predominantly astrocytic phenotype associating with MYB/MYBL alterations suggest a role of MYB/MYBL in these tumor categories with distinct characteristics.\n",
      "- ID 11781: Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2). All five DA2 samples with 8q focal gains exhibited a common centromeric breakpoint within MYBL1 after exon 9, resulting in partial duplication of MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged DA2 demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication with the telomeric sequence located in MMP16. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional DA2s with MYBL1 partial duplication. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas (AGs) in the related gene MYB on 6q23.3. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n",
      "- ID 12060: In this 2014 study, the authors compared 10 primary sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas (SEF), 4 cases of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), and one primary hybrid SEF/LGFMS. Patients with LGFMS ranged from 22 to 53 years of age.  All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement.  EWSR1::CREB3L1 was detected in SEF.  The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF while FUS::CREB3L2 is common in LGFMS, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.\n",
      "- ID 12062: In this study, an RT-PCR assay detected a FUS::CREB3L2 transcript in 14 of 16 (88%) low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) cases, whereas the fusion was not detected in any of the 123 other soft-tissue tumors (including desmoid-type fibromatoses, myxofibrosarcomas, soft-tissue perineuriomas, and congenital or adult fibrosarcomas). Patients ages ranged from 13 to 58 years. The fusion product involved exon 6 of FUS and exon 5 of CREB3L2 in the majority of cases. This supports FUS::CREB3L2 detection as a reliable approach to accurately diagnose LGFMS.\n",
      "- ID 12061: RT-PCR analysis of 59 low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas (LGFMS) and 52 non-LGFMS tumors selected for their resemblance to LGFMS (LGFMS-like tumors), identified a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion in 45 cases, a FUS::CREB3L1 in 3 cases, and no fusion in 11 cases of LGFMS. FUS exon 6 and CREB3L2 exon 5 were most frequently rearranged. Median age at LGFMS diagnosis was 35 years (range 11 to 75 years). 7 of 52 non-LGMFS neoplasms contained a FUS-CREB3L2 fusion with 4 of these diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, a sarcoma known to have molecular and morphological overlap with LGMFS.  The presence of these FUS fusions and the histology may be helpful in diagnosis.\n",

Notably, genomic abnormalities were exclusively observed in diffuse gliomas.The findings suggest that MYB dysregulation may contribute to pediatric gliomas through various mechanisms beyond amplification and deletion.\n",
      "- ID 11769: Comprehensive molecular studies through whole genome, whole exome, transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide copy number analysis, clustering analysis by DNA methylation profiling, as well as mutation hotspot analysis by Sanger sequencing and FISH were performed in a cohort of 91 low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs) in 2016. Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and the dominant lesions were MYB fusions (21/32; 66%). A MYB::QKI fusion characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (13/15; 87%) with the reamining two tumors harborting a MYB::ESR1 fusion (1/15) or QKI rearrangement (1/15). The last case with QKI rearrangement had no apparent involvement of MYB or MYBL1, only showing split signals using FISH break-apart probes across QKI. However, the study did not have sufficient derivatives from this tumor for FFPE RNA-seq, so it was unable to determine whether a cryptic MYB::QKI aberration was present in this case, or whether QKI was fused to another gene partner. Most MYB::QKI fusions (78%) were between MYB exon 15 and QKI exon 5. Fusions were also identified between MYB exon 9 and QKI exon 5. These fusions removed the 3'UTR regulatory site or the entire inhibitory C-terminal domain of MYB, leading to its overexpression. Two tumors with a MYB::QKI fusion also harbored a BRAF p.V600E mutation.\n",
      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",
      "- ID 10362: In a further investigation of non-traditional sarcoma cases, a 41-year-old man was thought to have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in the neck and spinal cord, but large rhabdoid/epithelioid cell morphology and retained H3K27Me3. Metastatic lesions were found in the lung and spine. Pan-TRK immunostain was positive and RNA NGS detected a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion. The authors state this is the first report of a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion in a sarcoma, which seems to forecast high-grade morphology and behavior.\n",
      "- ID 10896: From a retrospective review of 38,095 tumor samples from 33,997 patients that underwent fusion screening at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 87 tumors were found to be positive for an NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusion. One positive patient with Glioblastoma Multiforme had an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 (e11::e14) fusion that was not detected by MSK-IMPACT, but was found with the RNA Archer screen. Detection of this fusion was positive in the cytoplasm by Pan-Trk immunohistochemical staining.\n",
      "- ID 8653: A case report showing a two-year-old girl with an unusual pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) with both classic- and anaplastic- appearing tumors. A custom NGS panel identified a novel KANK1-NTRK2 fusion in both the classic and anaplastic regions. The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.\n",
      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",

For the remaining 6 cases, the fusion partner of TFE3 was unable to be determined. The authors conclude that despite an identical gene fusion, the RCCs are distinct from the corresponding mesenchymal neoplasms and that the data can expand further the clinicopathologic features of cancers with specific TFE3 gene fusions.\n",
      "- ID 11532: Argani, et al. (2001) included eight morphologically distinctive renal cell carcinomas with the t(X;17) translocation as seen in alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), with the distinction that the t(X;17) translocation is cytogenetically balanced in these renal tumors. The patients ranged from 17 months to 17 years of age. RT-PCR performed on the extracted RNA identified the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion product in all eight cases. Seven of the cases contained the type 1 product, a fusion of ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 4, whereas one cases showed a type 2 product, a fusion of ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 3.   These cases were initially diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) but upon further analysis were recognized to contain similarities to ASPS, likely due to the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion suggesting they are a distinctive subset of RCC. Of note, ASPSCR1::TFE3 is referred to by the alternative name ASPL-TFE3 in this paper.\n",
      "- ID 11526: A 4 year old African American girl was seen for a lesion on the scalp. Punch biopsy was done on a largely skin-colored subcutaneous nodule. Subcutaneous nodular aggregations of heavily pigmented epithelioid melanocytes were seen, with melanophages and a small amount of lymphocytes. Proliferation index (Ki-67) was less than 5%. The child was diagnosed with Pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (PEM), which usually occurs spontaneously as solitary neoplasms in otherwise healthy patients, and rarely spreads beyond the lymph node basin. Comparative genomic hybridization array showed gains and losses at 15q and losses at 17q. The authors note that melanoma often shows three or more segmental amplifications or deletions in reproducible loci, but the alterations in this patient were not commonly seen. A breakpoint was seen in the amplified regions involving the NTRK3 gene with an amplification of 5' end and loss of 3' end and this indicated a possible fusion. Next generation sequencing confirmed the presence of NTRK3 amplification at the 5' end and loss at the 3' end. In addition, an in-frame fusion with NTRK3 at the 5' end was found involving NTRK3 exons 1 to 7 and SCAPER exons 13 to 31 as the 3' partner. This fusion did not include NTRK3 kinase domain (exons 13-18). The tumor was excised with narrow margins and follow up showed no evidence for underlying Carney complex.\n",

This sensitivity is attributed to the drug's ability to effectively inhibit the aberrant FLT3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for the survival and proliferation of leukemic cells.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

      "- ID 1282: In this Phase II trial of 87 patients (NCT01871805), alectinib was assayed for safety and efficacy in ALK positive NSCLC that had progressed on crizotinib. Of 69 patients with measurable disease, 35 achieved objective response, with median duration of response 13.5 months. Of 16 patients with measurable CNS disease, four achieved CNS complete response and 8 showed CNS partial response. median duration of CNS response was 11.1 months. 2 deaths were observed, and 1 was judged related to study treatment.\n",
      "- ID 7284: In a phase 3 trial, 303 patients with NSCLC with ALK fusion were randomly assigned to alectinib arm (N=152) or crizotinib arm (N=151). PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than with crizotinib (HR for disease progression or death 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.65, p<0.001). Investigator-assessed RR was 82.9% in alectinib arm and 75.5% in crizotinib arm. CNS RR in patients with measurable CNS lesions was 81% and 50% for alectinib and crizotinib, respectively. Eight patients in the alectinib group, in comparison to one patient with crizotinib, had a complete CNS response. Despite longer treatment duration for alectinib, there were fewer grade 3-5 adverse events compared with crizotinib treatment.\n",
      "- ID 1273: In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.\n",
      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",
      "- ID 1279: In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.\n",
      "- ID 8657: A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).\n",
      "- ID 11578: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion.  IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel revealed a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) fusion that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. Surgical resection was not an option due to tumor size and location. The patient was enrolled into a phase II trial and treated with 600mg of entrectinib daily. After 1 month, the mass showed near-complete loss of enhancement and density (Hounsfield units dropped from 200 to 55-60). At week 12, response plateau was reached with the lesion reducing by 45% (RECIST 1.1). Due to the exceptional response, vertebrectomy was possible and completed. The patient continued entrectinib and has been recurrence free for 7 months.\n",
      "- ID 11354: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, the entrectinib retained activity against both the wild type and the NTRK1 F589L gatekeeper mutation with IC50s of 0.30 +/- 0.1 and <0.2 nM respectively.\n",
      "- ID 10095: BaF3 cells were transduced with a number of NTRK fusions. IC50 values were measured following treatment with entrectinib: TPM3-NTRK1 (2.5nM), LMNA-NTRK1 (1.4nM), ETV6-NTRK1 (2.5nM), VCL-NTRK2 (4.3nM), AFAP1-NTRK2 (2.7nM), ETV6-NTRK2 (4.5nM), ETV6-NTRK3 (3.8nM), and control (>1000nM).\n",
      "- ID 8900: After disease progression with no objective response to therapy, a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver displayed elevated NTRK1 expression in both primary tumor and liver metastasis as measured by immunohistochemistry. FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 11 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Fusion expression of both transcripts was confirmed by western blot, and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. After 4 weeks of treatment with Entrectinib, CT scan revealed the patient showed a partial response with a 30% reduction of target lesions. This response was maintained for 5 months.\n",
      "- ID 2960: A gene fusion between exon 11 of LMNA and exon 10 of NTRK1 was observed in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer after therapy with first-line FOLFOX, second-line FOLFIRI/cetuximab, and third-line irinotecan. The patient treated in a clinical trial with pan-TRK kinase inhibitor entrectinib. Treatment was well tolerated and led to a partial response (PR) with 30% tumor shrinkage of multiple liver metastases. Clinical response lasted 4 months.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The VHL gene has a low rate of benign missense variation and is known to be definitively associated with VHL disease. The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.\n",

      "- ID 11519: RNA-seq transcriptome analysis in a discovery cohort of 170 B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL)  cases negative for the common classifying cytogenetic aberrations identified several well-defined hierarchical expression clusters. Four clusters corresponded to known oncogenic subtypes, namely ZNF384, ERG/DUX4, BCR::ABL1-like, and KMT2A/MLL-rearranged. An additional cluster comprised 14 cases (8.2%), which lacked any fusion gene. Mutational analysis of RNA-seq data revealed the presence of a unique PAX5 mutation, c.239C>G, p.Pro80Arg (p.P80R), in all cases. In an additional cohort of 419 unselected BCP-ALL cases, PAX5 P80R was identified in 16 (5.3%). The authors conclude that the PAX5 P80R variant, with its distinct transcriptional signature, defines a subtype of BCP-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 7291: Integrated genomic analysis was performed for 1,988 childhood and adult B-ALL cases. Forty four cases (2.2%) showed the P80R substitution in the DNA binding domain for the PAX5 transcription factor gene. These cases were characterized by a unique expression profile. In the majority of the cases the mutation was hemizygous or homozygous, owing to deletion of the wild-type PAX5 allele or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. In 96% (42 of 44) of cases, the PAK5 P80R was accompanied by RAS and/or JAK-STAT signaling-pathway alterations (such as NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, NF1, IL7R), thereby suggesting cooperativity between deregulated PAX5 activity and kinase signaling.  The PAX5 P80R is proposed to define a distinct subtype of B-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 7290: In a large-scale international study RNA sequencing was performed to delineate the transcriptome landscape of 1,223 B-cell ALL cases. Twenty two cases were found to have P80R misense mutation in the DNA-binding domain of the PAX5 transcription factor gene. The P80R cases had unique expression profile and did not have any other known key driver mutations. The P80R is proposed to define a specific molecular/genetic subtype of B-ALL.   .\n",
      "- ID 6742: Thirteen unrelated Korean subjects and their family members were tested for VHL mutations with direct sequencing and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification. Clinical manifestations and family histories were recorded for each subject. Genetic testing confirmed a c.208G>A missense mutation in members of family #2,3,4. Family #2; A 25-year-old male Korean proband presented with a central nervous system hemangioblastoma. This patient had no family history of VHL. Family #3; A 46-year-old female Korean proband presented with bilateral retinal hemangioblastomas. The patient's 19-year-old son was found to share her mutation, but did not exhibit and VHL symptoms at the time of the study. The proband had a sister with retinal hemangioblastoma, but she did not receive genetic testing. Family #4; A 20-year-old female Korean proband presented with bilateral retinal hemangioblastomas. The patient has a mother who had received treatment for retinal hemangioblastoma, but refused to undergo genetic analysis. No other VHL symptoms were observed in the proband or her mother. Suggested ACMG Code: 'PP4' because the patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 5805: A case report of a 74-year-old male with colorectal adenocarcinoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system. The spinal hemangioblastoma was histopathologically confirmed. Bilateral multifocal cerebellar hemangioblastomas were inferred on brain MRI. Family history included a mother with a brain tumor of unconfirmed pathology, 2 brothers with the E70K variant and renal cell carcinoma, and an asymptomatic son in his 40s who was also found to have this variant. ACMG evidence codes: 'PP1' because of cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene known to cause the disease, 'PP4' because the patient's phenotype and family history are highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 6860: Medical records of 26 patients with germline mutations of the VHL gene who had been diagnosed with VHL disease in Severance Hospital (Seoul, Republic of Korea) and Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Republic of Korea) between 2003 and 2012 were reviewed. 9 unrelated patients diagnosed with Type 1 VHL disease shared the same VHL germline missense mutation (c.208G>A; p.Glu70Lys). The patients' phenotypes were as follows: 55 year old male with multiple CNS hemangioblastomas (patient 3), 55Y male with multiple CNS hemangioblastomas (Patient 4), 43Y male with multiple CNS hemangioblastomas (other phenotypic data not available, Patient 5), 11Y male with bilateral retinal hemangioblastoma (patient 6), 48Y female with CNS hemangioblastoma (Patient 7) , 64Y female with CNS hemangioblastoma (patient 8), 16Y F with retinal hemangioblastoma (Patient 9), 41Y female with CNS hemangioblastoma (patient 10).  One patient has concurrent missense and splicing mutations (208G>A and IVS1+5G>C). 52 year old male with retinal hemangioblstoma. ACMG codes as follows: PM1 Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g., active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.\n",
      "- ID 6503: Data was collected from 82 VHL mutation carriers in the Dutch VHL surveillance program. One patient age 20Y at the last follow-up had retinal hemangioblastoma and a germline c.208G>A (p.Glu70Lys) mutation in the VHL gene. Family history was not described.\n",
      "- ID 5780: In the analysis of 63 clinically diagnosed VHL patients, 55 patients were found with pancreatic involvement. Genetic tests on 35 of 55 VHL patients revealed VHL variants in 28 patients. Of the 55 enrolled patients, hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system were previously documented in 47 patients, renal cell carcinoma in 25, and pheochromocytoma in 11 patients. This missense variant was found in 37-year-old female with reported VHL type 1 phenotype and pancreatic lesions (case no. 1).\n",
      "- ID 5273: Screening of 92 unrelated patients with VHL disease revealed 61 DNA variants. No variants were found in 96 control cases. This missense mutation was found in a VHL type 1 patient (patient no. V374). This patient was further described in Hes et al 2007 (family no. 5) to have bilateral, retinal hemangioblastoma.\n",
      "- ID 9588: One patient was identified with a LMNA-NTRK1 positive tumor in this Phase I study (NCT02122913), which involved 70 heavily pretreated patients with a median age of 59.5 years, with multiple solid tumor types. A total of eight patients had NTRK fusions, and by independent radiology review, all patients with TRK fusion were considered to have had an objective response. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion. Authors concluded that NTRK fusions may represent tissue and age agnostic oncogenic drivers, and that Larotrectinib was well tolerated in the patients and demonstrated activity in all tumors with NTRK fusions.\n",
      "- ID 11576: A 31-year-old female presented with a pigmented nodule on her scalp that enlarged in size over a 2-year period. Biopsy demonstrated a fascicular proliferation of bland spindle cells within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and was found in adipose tissue in a “honeycomb pattern.” Immunohistochemical staining revealed the spindle cells were positive for CD34 and S-100 protein and were negative for SOX10. FISH was negative for PDGFB rearrangement. The spindle cells were positive for pan-NTRK by IHC and targeted RNA sequencing revealed the LMNA::NTRK1 e2::e10 fusion. The patient’s tumor was completely excised, and no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease was found at 24-month follow-up. The authors indicate the tumor analyses demonstrate a diagnosis of a NTRK-rearranged LPF-NT with unusual histopathological findings that include lymphoid aggregates and pigmented dendritic melanocytes.\n",
      "- ID 11577: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion. Biopsy revealed a spindle cell mesenchymal tumor with monotonous, bland spindle cells mixed with fat and blood vessels. IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Due to the unusual tumor location, an anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel was used and detected a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. The author’s reclassified their diagnosis to an S-100 positive LPF-NT of the spine based on the identification of the fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11578: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion.  IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel revealed a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) fusion that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. Surgical resection was not an option due to tumor size and location. The patient was enrolled into a phase II trial and treated with 600mg of entrectinib daily. After 1 month, the mass showed near-complete loss of enhancement and density (Hounsfield units dropped from 200 to 55-60). At week 12, response plateau was reached with the lesion reducing by 45% (RECIST 1.1). Due to the exceptional response, vertebrectomy was possible and completed. The patient continued entrectinib and has been recurrence free for 7 months.\n",
      "- ID 11650: A 3-year-old girl presented with spots on her right buttock that evolved into lumps. Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse subcutaneous tissue thickening without significant involvement of underlying soft tissue. Punch biopsy demonstrated small whorls and fascicles of bland spindled cells with no mitotic activity, atypical mitotic figures, or nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical staining resulted in CD34 positivity in the lesional cells, negative S100-protein in the spindle cells, and positive Pan-Trk staining in the spindled-cells. Transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) revealed the presence of an in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 fusion (exon4::exon10) that includes the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. According to the authors, this case presents grounds to use pan-Trk staining to determine the diagnosis of LPF versus LPF-NT S100 detection can vary in rare instances.\n",
      "- ID 11354: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, the entrectinib retained activity against both the wild type and the NTRK1 F589L gatekeeper mutation with IC50s of 0.30 +/- 0.1 and <0.2 nM respectively.\n",
      "- ID 11349: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, the first generation inhibitor larotrectinib was 28-150 fold less active against fusions with mutations in the NTRK1 kinase domain.  The IC50 for LMNA:NTRK1 with no mutation was 23.5 nM while the IC50s for the LMNA:NTRK1 fusion with G595R (solvent front), F589L (gatekeeper), or G667C (xDFG) mutation were 3540, 675, and 1630 nM respectively.\n",
      "- ID 11346: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, repotrectinib retained the greatest activity against fusions with mutations in the NTRK1 kinase domain.  The Ba/F3 proliferation IC50 for LMNA:NTRK1 with no mutation was <0.2 nM while the IC50s for the LMNA:NTRK1 fusion with G595R (solvent front), F589L (gatekeeper), G667C (xDFG), or G595R+F589L were 0.2, <0.2, 11.8, and 17.7 respectively. Repotrectinib also inhibited autophosphorylation of LMNA:NTRK1 in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the construct at low concentrations.\n",
      "- ID 10095: BaF3 cells were transduced with a number of NTRK fusions. IC50 values were measured following treatment with entrectinib: TPM3-NTRK1 (2.5nM), LMNA-NTRK1 (1.4nM), ETV6-NTRK1 (2.5nM), VCL-NTRK2 (4.3nM), AFAP1-NTRK2 (2.7nM), ETV6-NTRK2 (4.5nM), ETV6-NTRK3 (3.8nM), and control (>1000nM).\n",
      "- ID 8901: FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft of a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 10 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Expression was confirmed by Western and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. Western blot of the tumor also indicated constitutive activation of the fusion based on phosphorylation of the fusion. Additionally, downstream kinase targets (PLCγ1, AKT, and MAPK) were also phosphorylated in the tumor, similar to levels observed in the TPM3-NTRK1 containing KM12 colorectal cancer cell line.\n",
      "- ID 8900: After disease progression with no objective response to therapy, a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver displayed elevated NTRK1 expression in both primary tumor and liver metastasis as measured by immunohistochemistry. FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 11 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Fusion expression of both transcripts was confirmed by western blot, and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. After 4 weeks of treatment with Entrectinib, CT scan revealed the patient showed a partial response with a 30% reduction of target lesions. This response was maintained for 5 months.\n",
      "- ID 2955: LOXO-101 is an orally administered inhibitor of the TRK kinase and is highly selective only for the TRK family of receptors. The tumor of a 41-year-old woman with soft-tissue sarcoma metastatic to the lung was found to harbor an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 (exon 2 & exon 11) gene fusion encoding a functional LMNA-TRKA fusion oncoprotein. This patient's tumors underwent rapid and substantial tumor regression, with an accompanying improvement in pulmonary dyspnea, oxygen saturation, and plasma tumor markers.\n",
      "- ID 2960: A gene fusion between exon 11 of LMNA and exon 10 of NTRK1 was observed in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer after therapy with first-line FOLFOX, second-line FOLFIRI/cetuximab, and third-line irinotecan. The patient treated in a clinical trial with pan-TRK kinase inhibitor entrectinib. Treatment was well tolerated and led to a partial response (PR) with 30% tumor shrinkage of multiple liver metastases. Clinical response lasted 4 months.\n",
      "- ID 6100: One Patient with soft tissue sarcoma and a NTRK1-LMNA fusion had a partial response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",
      "- ID 6391: A 14-month-old boy presented with a slow-growing, asymptomatic back plaque, which was biopsied and found to have S100 positivity, sparse CD34 staining, and no significant mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism, or necrosis. IHC detected cytoplasmic expression of NTRK1 and FISH detected the LMNA::NTRK1 fusion. Based on these findings the authors conclude this is patient has a lipofibromatosis-like neural tumor (LPF-NT). The patient was treated with wide local excision and has developed no complications or evidence of recurrence with 6 months of follow-up time. LPF-NT is rare, with 14 cases previously reported, and this patient was the first report of this diagnosis in infancy.\n",
      "- ID 8878: A mass found at birth in a patient’s left arm became enlarged at age 2 and was resected and characterized as a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma. FISH and RT-PCR did not detect any common sarcoma translocations. A recurrence and a new mass formed after 4 months of therapy, so amputation was performed. Metastatic high-grade sarcoma appeared in the lungs 4 months later followed by multiple recurrences 10 months after treatment. Whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of diagnosis and normal samples were performed and the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact was discovered. Treatment with Crizotinib was started and a chest CT after 2 months revealed partial response. After 22 months of therapy, chest CT revealed a complete response of lung nodules, which has been sustained >18 months beyond the conclusion of treatment at 31 months.\n",
      "- ID 8902: A 40-year-old patient with a left calf mass revealed by biopsy to be a low grade myxoid spindle cell carcinoma underwent surgery and radiotherapy. Over a 5-year period, the patient experienced 3 lung metastases, which were all resected. At year 6, unresectable metastases were found in the lungs and lymph nodes. FISH and targeted next generation RNA sequencing of an earlier lung metastasis revealed and confirmed an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact. TRK inhibitor was administered and PET-CT scan revealed near complete response and no new lesions 1 year later.\n",
      "- ID 8903: The in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 11) with intact kinase domain was found and confirmed by next generation sequencing, RT-PCR, FISH, and/or immunohistochemistry in 3 Spitz neoplasm cases. Compared to controls (wildtype NTRK1 overexpression and GFP), lentiviral mediated overexpression of LMNA-NTRK1 in mouse melanocyte cells (melan-a) displayed increased phosphorylation of the fusion and downstream kinase targets, as assessed by Western Blot. Treatment with the NTRK1 inhibitor, AZ-23, quenched fusion and pathway activation. Additionally, injection of LMNA-NTRK1 melan-a cells into immunocompromised mice resulted in the rapid growth of tumors at the injection site within 40 days. Similar results were observed in mice injected with melan-a cells overexpressing NRAS G12V or HRAS G12V, but no tumors were observed in mice injected with GFP control melan-a cells.\n",
      "- ID 8904: A total of 140 Spitzoid neoplasm cases were analyzed by FISH and/or targeted DNA and RNA sequencing (n=38). Mutually exclusive kinase fusions were found in 72 cases. NTRK1 fusions were observed in 23 cases (8/75 Spitz naevi; 8/32 atypical Spitz tumors; 7/33 Spitzoid melanomas) and their expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. NTRK1 expression was absent in cases without a NTRK1 rearrangement. A 743kb deletion leading to the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 11) with the kinase domain intact was found in 3/38 NGS analyzed cases (1 nevus, 1 atypical, 1Spitzoid) and was verified by RT-PCR.\n",

      "- ID 11880: This study evaluated the independent prognostic significance of pretreatment cytogenetics based on the large Medical Research Council (MRC) AML 10 trial which enrolled a total of 1,966 patients (364 children and 1,602 adults). All patients diagnosed with de novo AML (337 children and 1,460 adults) or secondary AML (22 children and 119 adults) received comparable therapy. The study concluded that patients with different cytogenetic abnormalities can be divided into 3 prognostic subgroups with favorable, intermediate, and adverse outcomes solely based on the results of cytogenetics. AML with t(8;21) [which results in RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion] was grouped together with AML with inv(16) [CBFB::MYH11 fusion] and t(15;17) [PML::RARA fusion] in the favorable group. The 122 patients with AML with t(8;21) had a 98% CR (complete remission) rate and 2% induction deaths. The observed prognostic associations further support that these abnormalities define clinically and biologically distinct AML subtypes.\n",
      "- ID 11882: The authors of this 1997 paper compared morphologic and cytochemical features between 30 acute myeloid leukemia subtype M2 (AML-M2) patients with t(8;21)  and  50 AML-M2 patients without t(8;21). Morphologic characteristics highly enriched in cases positive for t(8;21) included irregular nuclear shape, Auer bodies, at least 90% myeloperoxidase positivity in blast cells, pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly of the nuclei, and homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils. These features were observed in 90-100% of the t(8;21) positive cases and were rare in the t(8;21) negative group. Homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils was the most characteristic of t(8;21)positive AML-M2, while pale-colored cytoplasm without any granules in mature neutrophils or dyserythropoietic features was never observed in association with t(8;21). The study suggests association of the t(8;21) with a subtype of AML that has morphologically recognizable features in a high proportion of cases.  Of note, AML with t(8;21) translocation is now known to result in a RUNX1::RUNX1T fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11878: In this 1992 study, the authors isolated a clone containing the junction region of the (8;21)(q22;q22) translocation characteristic for acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21). Using probes from the junction clone, the presence of this consistent junction region was confirmed in 9 independent cases of AML with t(8;21). The authors also isolated cDNA clones from a t(8;21) AML cDNA library that contained fused sequences from chromosomes 8 and 21. This allowed them to identify the chromosome 8 partner gene which they named ETO (currently known as RUNX1T1) and confirm the chromosome 21 partner as AML1 (currently RUNX1), which showed similarity with the Drosophila segmentation gene, runt. The consequence of the t(8;21) was determined to be the juxtaposition of 5' sequences of AML1 (RUNX1) to 3' sequences of ETO (RUNX1T1), oriented telomere to centromere on the der(8) chromosome. The study confirms that t(8;21) consistently results in an oncogenic fusion between specific partner genes, confirming its role as a defining oncogenic abnormality in a subtype of AML.\n",
      "- ID 11879: The researchers analyzed immunophenotype in 30 cases of newly diagnosed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibiting M2 morphology per French-American-British classification. They correlated these findings with cytogenetic data. In 16 out of the 30 cases, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation or its variants were detected. The leukemias harboring t(8;21) did not significantly vary from other M2 cases regarding expression of various cell surface markers like CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD36, CD41a, CD42b, CDw65, TdT, or HLA-DR. However, the B-cell antigen CD19 expression was observed in 81% of t(8;21) cases compared to only 7% of non-t(8;21) M2 cases. Moreover, 63% of t(8;21) cases exhibited the NK-cell antigen CD56 expression versus 14% of non-t(8;21) M2 leukemias. Coexpression of CD19 and CD56 was exclusively found in the t(8;21) group. This coexpression pattern was absent in 48 cases of other AML subtypes lacking t(8;21). Additionally, non-t(8;21) M2 cases frequently expressed CD2 or CD7, while none of the t(8;21) cases did. The authors deduced that t(8;21) defines a biologically unique pediatric M2 AML subgroup with distinct immunophenotypic features differentiating it from other de novo AML types.\n",

The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).\n",

Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 8917: All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",
      "- ID 8931: The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 6099: Four out of six patients with infantile fibrosarcoma and a ETV6-NTRK3 fusion had a partial response, the remaining two had a complete response with larotrectinib.

In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response.

Clinicopathologic characterization of these 7 cases with FUS fusions and 8 FUS-rearranged SBRCTs reported in the literature described the morphology as monomorphic round cell cytomorphology (keeping with a classic Ewing sarcoma phenotype) with diffuse membranous CD99 reactivity in all except one case with patchy staining.  Of note, there were 4 patients in this group who had scored negative for EWSR1 FISH that were positive for EWSR1::ERG  by other means (FusionSeq, RT-PCR, etc.) and the authors caution of the false negatives with EWSR1 FISH due to the complexity of the the EWSR1::ERG rearrangement.  The authors conclude that these rarer alternative fusions also lead to classic Ewing sarcoma.\n",

RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28).  Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses.   The two tumors with EWSR1::ERG had breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG with a t(2;22) rearrangement detected in 1 of these 2 cases by karyotyping.

Both individuals were identified with renal cell carcinoma and one also presented with a CNS hemangioblastoma. Additional information regarding the family information, including a pedigree, were not provided. ACMG evidence codes: 'flag for PP4' since the patients phenotype and family history is consistent with VHL, 'flag for PP1' because there is co-segregation of variant with the phenotype in two members of the family.\n",
      "- ID 8491: Of 14 patients with retinal vascular proliferation and known family history of VHL disease, 12 patients were enrolled in an approved study protocol at the National Cancer Institute. 11 of these patients underwent genetic testing and were found to have mutations in the VHL gene. Patient 1 presented with retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH) in her left eye at age the age of 13, which was treated with radiation. At age 62 years, this eye had good visual acuity (20/20) without any RCHs. As of her last visit, patient 1 also presented with abnormalities in the CNS, pancreas and kidney. She was found to have the L184P (c.551T>C) mutation. Her last known age was 69 years old. ACMG evidence codes: 'PP4' since the patient presents phenotypes highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 6119: Thirty-five unrelated patients suspected of having von Hippel-Lindau disease had genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes analyzed using sequence analysis of the coding region for VHL / Southern blot analyses. 32 VHL gene variants were found in 35 patients. An association of clear cell renal carcinoma development with a relatively high loss of structural stability in VHL protein missense mutations was discovered, although this only reached significance when combining data from other studies (p=0.101 for present study; p=0.0086 for present study + other study data). This missense variant was found in a patient with spinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, retinal hemangioblastomas, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, and cysts of the broad ligament (patient no. F43). The patient was 27 years old. ACMG PP4 as patient's phenotypes are highly specific for VHL disease.\n",
      "- ID 5055: 93 families that fulfilled the clinical criteria of VHL disease were assessed for germline mutations in the VHL gene, and mutations were found in all affected family members. The c.551T>C (p.L184P) mutation was found in a family (Lineage 14) in which members were clinically diagnosed with VHL presenting without pheochromocytoma (VHL type 1), however, no further phenotypic information about specific patients was provided. This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript (AF010238.1). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot. Relevant ACMG codes include: PP4, because the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 12009: RNA sequencing identified NUTM1 fusions in six patients with primary undifferentiated soft tissue and visceral tumors.  Fusions included BRD4::NUTM1 (three cases), BRD3::NUTM1, MXD1::NUTM1, and BCORL1::NUTM1, however only the BRD4::NUTM1 and BRD3::NUTM1 cases were positive for NUTM1 IHC.   Independent testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of the NUTM1 and partner gene rearrangement.  The breakpoints were located at NUTM1 exon 3 or 5 (NM_001284292.1) and BRD4 exon 11 (NM_058243.2) or BRD3 exon 9 (NM_007371.3). Despite some overlap with NUT midline carcinoma, the authors note that the tumors observed also differed in several ways, tentatively labeled these malignant neoplasms as \"NUT-associated tumors\", and speculate that they might represent an overarching category that also includes NUT midline carcinoma.\n",
      "- ID 12050: In this 2020 study, the authors included a total of 141 NUT carcinomas defined by rearrangement of NUTM1 detected by IHC, cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The median age at diagnosis was 24 years (range of 18 days to 80 years). Fusion partners were confirmed by either cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The majority  (78%) of tumors harbored a BRD4::NUTM1 fusion, 15% harbored a BRD3::NUTM1  fusion, 6% harbored a NSD3::NUTM1 fusion, 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF532::NUTM1 fusion and 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF592::NUTM1 fusion. For the remaining 14 cases the fusion partner gene to NUTM1 was not identified. The majority of tumors arose from the thorax or head and neck, but tumors were also seen in bone, soft tissue, and kidney. Outcomes in patients were overall poor, however, the authors conclude that they have identified three clinically and molecularly defined prognostic risk groups: group A is nonthoracic, BRD3::NUTM1, or NSD3::NUTM1 with a significantly improved prognosis (OS of 36.5 months); group B is nonthoracic, BRD4::NUTM1 with a poor prognosis (OS of 10 months); and group C is thoracic with a very poor prognosis (OS of 3.5 to 5.6 months) regardless of the NUTM1 fusion partner.\n",
      "- ID 12049: In this 2017 study, the authors sought to characterize NUT carcinomas. They included a cohort of 12 aggressive malignant tumors with rearrangement of the NUTM1 gene, assessed by RT-PCR, FISH, positive nuclear NUTM1 immunohistochemistry, and/or t(15; 19) detection by cytogenetics. The median age at onset was 18 years (with a range of 12 –50 years). RT-PCR or FISH confirmed the fusion partner as BRD4 in 9 of 12 cases, and a finding of t(15;19) (q13;p13) by cytogenetics confirmed BRD4 as the partner in 1 case.  All cases tested had positive anti-NUTM1 antibody immunostaining. The primary tumor was found to be lateralized in two-thirds of the cases, rather than localized to the midline, supporting the change in name from \"NUT midline carcinoma\" to \"NUT carcinoma\". The authors state that 50% of cases initially had an alternative diagnosis and recommend NUTM1-specific antibody immunostaining in cases of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinoma to properly diagnose NUT carcinoma at an earlier stage.\n",
      "- ID 12051: In this 2004 study, the authors sought to identify carcinomas with translocation t(15;19)(q13, p13.1), which results in the novel oncogenic fusion BRD4::NUTM1 (described as NUT). The authors screened malignant tumors with epithelial differentiation, in patients less than 40 years of age, with poorly differentiated histomorphology, rapid clinical progression, and/or cytogenetic evidence of chromosome 15q or 19p rearrangement. In total, using FISH with dual-color assays evaluating chromosome 19p13.1 BRD4 and 15q13 NUTM1 breakpoints, they detected 11 tumors to have a NUTM1 rearrangement, with 7 of the cases detected in 98 previously unscreened samples and the others in known positive cases. Patients with a NUTM1 rearrangement ranged from 3 to 35 years of age. The NUTM1 rearrangement was consistent with BRD4::NUTM1 in 8/11 cases and 3/11 were found to have a rearrangement of NUTM1 but not BRD4, suggesting the existence of other rearrangements involving NUTM1 which the authors designate NUT-variant carcinomas. The authors conclude that NUTM1 rearranged carcinomas can arise from various midline epithelial surfaces and are associated with poor outcome.\n",
      "- ID 4858: In a randomized, open-label phase 3 trial 303 patients with ALK-positive, previously untreated NSCLC (including asympt. CNS disease) were randomized to reiceive either Alectinib or Crizotinib. During a median follow-up of 17.6 months (crizotinib) and 18.6 months (alectinib), an event of disease progression/death occurred in 41% (62/152  pt) in the alectinib group and 68% (102/151 patients) in the crizotinib group. 12-month event-free survival rate 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib. A total of 18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an event of CNS progression, compared to 68 patients (45%) in the crizotinib group. Response rates were 82.9% (Alectinib) and 75.5% (crizotinib).\n",
      "- ID 1200: This retrospective study of patients from the PROFILE 1001 and 1005 studies of crizotinib in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC assessed the potential benefit of crizotinib beyond progressive disease (CBPD), defined as continuation of crizotinib for 3 or more weeks after disease progression on crizotinib. 194 patients who had developed PD by data cutoff were studied, where 120 received crizotinib for a median duration of 19.4 weeks and 74 discontinued crizotinib after PD. No gross imbalances in clinicopathologic features of the two groups were evident.  Significantly longer overall survival was observed in the crizotinib continuing group from time of PD (16.4 vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17–0.42; P < 0.0001), and from the time of initial crizotinib (29.6 vs. 10.8 months; HR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19–0.46; P < 0.0001).\n",
      "- ID 1201: This prospective Phase III study named Profile 1014 on NSCLC ALK-rearranged patients assessed intracranial disease control rate (IC-DCR) in the subset of patients entering the study with preexisting treated brain metastasis (tBM). IC-DCR was significantly improved in the tBM group given crizotinib (N=39) over chemotherapy (pemetrexed + cisplatin or carboplatin; N=40) at 12 weeks (85% vs. 45%, P<0.001), and at 24 weeks (56% vs. 25%, P=0.006). Progression free survival was also significantly improved with crizotinib over chemotherapy in the tBM subgroup (9.0 vs. 4.0 months; HR 0.40; P<0.001), where in the intent to treat population it was 10.9 vs. 7.0 months (HR 0.45; P<0.001), indicating that the difficult to treat BM population obtained benefit from crizotinib at both the brain and systemic level.\n",
      "- ID 1419: In a retrospective study comparing survival outcomes in a subgroup of 82 ALK-positive crizotinib-treated patients enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT00585195), crizotinib therapy was associated with improved survival. For the crizotinib-treated, ALK-positive patient group, 1 year survival was 74% and 2 year overall survival was 54%, compared with 72% and 36% for the control group (ALK-positive crizotinib naive patients).\n",
      "- ID 1577: A phase-3 clinical trial evaluated 347 patients with ALK-positive lung cancer.  The study compared crizotinib treatment (n=173) with chemotherapy treatment of either pemetrexed or docetaxel (n=174).  In the crizotinib arm, the response rate was significantly higher (65% vs 20%; P<0.001), the progression-free survival was increased (7.7 months vs. 3.0 months; HR=0.49, 95%CI:14 months-26 months; p<0.001), however, there was no significant improvement in overall survival (HR=1.02; 95%CI:0.68-1.54; P=0.54).  Of the patients on crizotinib treatment, global quality of life was improved relative to baseline when compared to chemotherapy patients (+5 mean change, -5 mean change; P<0.001).\n",
      "- ID 1691: In an evaluation of a patient with crizotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma, an EML4-ALK-E13;A20 rearrangement was identified using CGP.  The patient attained a reduction in the target lesions by 14.2%, however, the patient relapsed 17 months later.\n",
      "- ID 1187: In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.\n",
      "- ID 1207: In the PROFILE 1001 study of crizotinib in 82 patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, 31 patients with sufficient tumor material were tested using RT-PCR for the presence of certain EML4-ALK variants.  13/31 tested patients had the EML4-ALK variant 1. Of these, 12/13 had a partial response, and 1 had stable disease. This response rate of 92% is in contrast to the 57% response rate in the overall patient population, but the numbers of patients with specific EML4-ALK breakpoints were insufficient to correlate with patient response rate.\n",
      "- ID 1245: This case study presented a 53-year-old never-smoker with a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm. Morphology and immunohistochemistry were unable to establish the primary tumor site. Right upper extremity (RUE), scalp, and multiple lung lesions were apparent. A lung lesion sample with sufficient material for molecular profiling was not attainable but sufficient material was present from the RUE for hybrid capture genomic profiling  (FoundationOne kit was used). EML4-ALK variant 3 was found, and the patient was started on crizotinib. Rapid symptom improvement was seen. After 1 month, a CT scan showed significant size reduction in lung tumors, and after 5 months the patient was asymptomatic with an entirely negative examination.\n",
      "- ID 1189: In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.\n",
      "- ID 1196: EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) were expressed in Ba/F3 cells using retrovirus.  While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 1190: Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.\n",
      "- ID 1193: In a set of 31 patients with NSCLC, RT-PCR was performed to test for known EML4-ALK variants.  Five patients tested positive for the 3a/3b EML4-ALK variant.  Of these, 4 had partial response (PR), and one had disease progression (DP), and this was the only DP in the group of 31.  In contrast, of the 13 testing positive for EML4-ALK variant 1, 12 showed PR, and 1 showed stable disease.  These results potentially mirror findings in the H2228 3a/3b containing NSCLC cell line where some literature indicates it does respond as strongly to ALK inhibition as other EML4-ALK NSCLC cell lines.\n",
      "- ID 1356: In Ba/F3 cells, crizotinib sensitivty of the NPM-ALK variant was compared to crizotinib sensitivity of EML4-ALK variant 3. 50% of maximal inhibitory concentration for NPM-ALK was 42 nM, which was approximately 4x greater than IC50 of 11 nM obtained for EML4-ALK. The IC50 for parental Ba/F3 supplemented with IL3 was 2299 nM, resulting in a fold difference of 209.2 for EML4-ALK and 55.1 for NPM-ALK, indicating some reduced sensitivity for NPM-ALK in direct comparison to EML4-ALK, but substantial sensitization to crizotinib for NPM-ALK in Ba/F3 cells.\n",
      "- ID 1197: Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) showed differential sensitivity to both crizotinib and TAE684, with variant 3a (E6;A20) being the least sensitive. The authors suggest that the type/structure of ALK fusion may have some impact on patient outcome in targeted therapy.\n",
      "- ID 262: A 28 year-old patient with non-small cell lung cancer that failed conventional therapy was found to harbor the EML4-ALK (E13;A20) fusion using reverse transcription PCR. Treatment with 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulted in rapid improvement of symptoms and disease control for 5 months.\n",
      "- ID 1198: This two arm Phase III study named PROFILE 1007 (NCT00932893) was performed to assess crizotinib vs. established chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients positive for ALK rearrangement (assessed by break-apart FISH) with locally advanced or metastatic disease. 347 patients with disease progression after one round of platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive crizotinib (N=173) or chemotherapy (N=174) consisting of pemetrexed in pemetrexed-naive patients and docetaxel for patients previously treated with pemetrexed. The primary endpoint - progression free survival (PFS) - was found to be significantly better for patients treated with crizotinib (median 7.7 months) than with chemotherapy (median 3.0 months) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001).

Patients with LGFMS ranged from 22 to 53 years of age.  All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement.  EWSR1::CREB3L1 was detected in SEF.  The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF while FUS::CREB3L2 is common in LGFMS, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.\n",

Patients ages ranged from 13 to 58 years. The fusion product involved exon 6 of FUS and exon 5 of CREB3L2 in the majority of cases. This supports FUS::CREB3L2 detection as a reliable approach to accurately diagnose LGFMS.\n",
      "- ID 12061: RT-PCR analysis of 59 low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas (LGFMS) and 52 non-LGFMS tumors selected for their resemblance to LGFMS (LGFMS-like tumors), identified a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion in 45 cases, a FUS::CREB3L1 in 3 cases, and no fusion in 11 cases of LGFMS. FUS exon 6 and CREB3L2 exon 5 were most frequently rearranged. Median age at LGFMS diagnosis was 35 years (range 11 to 75 years). 7 of 52 non-LGMFS neoplasms contained a FUS-CREB3L2 fusion with 4 of these diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, a sarcoma known to have molecular and morphological overlap with LGMFS.  The presence of these FUS fusions and the histology may be helpful in diagnosis.\n",

Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse subcutaneous tissue thickening without significant involvement of underlying soft tissue. Punch biopsy demonstrated small whorls and fascicles of bland spindled cells with no mitotic activity, atypical mitotic figures, or nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical staining resulted in CD34 positivity in the lesional cells, negative S100-protein in the spindle cells, and positive Pan-Trk staining in the spindled-cells. Transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) revealed the presence of an in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 fusion (exon4::exon10) that includes the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. According to the authors, this case presents grounds to use pan-Trk staining to determine the diagnosis of LPF versus LPF-NT S100 detection can vary in rare instances.\n",
      "- ID 11577: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion. Biopsy revealed a spindle cell mesenchymal tumor with monotonous, bland spindle cells mixed with fat and blood vessels. IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Due to the unusual tumor location, an anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel was used and detected a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. The author’s reclassified their diagnosis to an S-100 positive LPF-NT of the spine based on the identification of the fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11576: A 31-year-old female presented with a pigmented nodule on her scalp that enlarged in size over a 2-year period. Biopsy demonstrated a fascicular proliferation of bland spindle cells within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and was found in adipose tissue in a “honeycomb pattern.” Immunohistochemical staining revealed the spindle cells were positive for CD34 and S-100 protein and were negative for SOX10. FISH was negative for PDGFB rearrangement. The spindle cells were positive for pan-NTRK by IHC and targeted RNA sequencing revealed the LMNA::NTRK1 e2::e10 fusion. The patient’s tumor was completely excised, and no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease was found at 24-month follow-up. The authors indicate the tumor analyses demonstrate a diagnosis of a NTRK-rearranged LPF-NT with unusual histopathological findings that include lymphoid aggregates and pigmented dendritic melanocytes.\n",

IHC detected cytoplasmic expression of NTRK1 and FISH detected the LMNA::NTRK1 fusion. Based on these findings the authors conclude this is patient has a lipofibromatosis-like neural tumor (LPF-NT). The patient was treated with wide local excision and has developed no complications or evidence of recurrence with 6 months of follow-up time. LPF-NT is rare, with 14 cases previously reported, and this patient was the first report of this diagnosis in infancy.\n",
      "- ID 7293: Among pediatric fibroblastic and myofibroblastic proliferating superficial lesions, lipofibromatosis (LPF), composed of an admixture of adipose tissue and fibroblastic elements, has been variously classified as infantile fibromatosis or fibrous hamartoma of infancy. In this article, a group of superficial soft tissue tumors occurring in children and young adults, with a notably infiltrative growth pattern reminiscent of LPF, variable cytologic atypia, and a distinct immunoprofile of S100 protein and CD34 reactivity, suggestive of neural differentiation, is described. To better characterize this group, genomic characterization (RNA sequencing) revealed NTRK1 fusions (TPR-NTRK1 and TPM3-NTRK1) in two index cases and in 10/14 additional cases (FISH). No NTRK1-rearrangements were found in 25 classic LPF.\n",

The patient was diagnosed with IFS at 6 months of age. At 16 months the patient enrolled in a pediatric Phase 1 trial of LOXO‐101 (Larotrectinib, ARRY-470), an experimental, highly selective inhibitor of TRK. The patient experienced a rapid, radiographic response, demonstrating the potential for LOXO‐101 to provide benefit for IFS harboring NTRK gene fusions.\n",

In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",

When evaluating 14 studies (n = 7778 patients), the odds ratio (OR) of a proximal lesion, which is associated with greater mortality in colon cancer, was increased for patients with BRAF mutations (OR 5.222, 95% CI 3.801–7.174, P < 0.001). When evaluating 4 studies (n = 1526 patients), the odds ratio of T4 tumors, which indicates tumor growth past bowel lining, was increased for patients with BRAF mutations (OR 1.761, 95% CI 1.164–2.663, P = 0.007). When evaluating 8 studies (n = 2786 patients), the odds ratio of poor tumor differentiation was increased in patients with BRAF mutations (OR 3.816, 95% CI 2.714–5.365, P < 0.001). These results support that BRAF mutations indicate poor prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer.\n",
      "- ID 1552: In a study of 908 patients with colorectal cancer, 45 patients had BRAF V600E mutations and 589 patients were BRAF wild type.  BRAF V600E mutations were more likely to be proximal tumors (68.9%, 20.7%; p<0.0001), they were more likely to be poorly differentiated (17.7%, 1.9%; p<0.0001), they were more likely to be mucinous carcinoma type (20.0%, 4.2%; p=0.0003), they were more likely to have lymphatic invasion (77.6%, 49.9%; p=0.0003), and they had a shorter survival time (31.1 mo, 41.6 mo; p=0.001).  The 3-year survival rate was significantly poorer in the V600E group when compared to the wild type group (63.8%, 87.9%; p<0.0001).\n",

      "- ID 7156: Patients with completely resected colorectal adenocarcinoma (Stage II-III) were treated with fluorouracil and leucovorin +/- ironotecan. Of the 1,307 FFPE samples tested, V600E was observed in 31 Stage II samples (7.6%) and 72 Stage III samples (7.9%). V600E was prognostic for overall survival, but not for relapse-free survival, in patients with stages II and III combined, and in stage III alone. For all MSI low and stable tumors, BRAF V600E positive samples had a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.19 (95% CI, 1.43 to 3.37, P=0.00034). For all samples in the cohort (MSI-H and MSI-L) BRAF V600E positive samples had a 1.66 HR (95% CI, 1.15 to 2.40, P=0.0069). The authors note prognostic value for BRAF V600E, especially in non-MSI high tumors.\n",

BRAF mutation status (V600E) was analyzed via LightMix BRAF V600E Kit. V600E mutations were detected in 60/999 tumor samples (6%), 59 of which were wild-type for KRAS. When comparing patients with wildtype KRAS (n=625), BRAF V600E tumors had worse outcomes relative to BRAF wildtype. For patients with BRAF V600E tumors (n=566), median overall survival (OS) was 25.1 months with cetuximab and 21.6 months without cetuximab.

Median overall survival was found to differ by mutation, regardless of treatment. Median overall survival was 8.8 months (IQR 4.5-27) for patients with BRAF variants, 14.4 months (IQR 8.5-24.0) for patients with KRAS variants, and 20.1 months (IQR 11.5-31.7) for wildtype patients.

Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",
      "- ID 6391: A 14-month-old boy presented with a slow-growing, asymptomatic back plaque, which was biopsied and found to have S100 positivity, sparse CD34 staining, and no significant mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism, or necrosis. IHC detected cytoplasmic expression of NTRK1 and FISH detected the LMNA::NTRK1 fusion. Based on these findings the authors conclude this is patient has a lipofibromatosis-like neural tumor (LPF-NT). The patient was treated with wide local excision and has developed no complications or evidence of recurrence with 6 months of follow-up time. LPF-NT is rare, with 14 cases previously reported, and this patient was the first report of this diagnosis in infancy.\n",
      "- ID 8878: A mass found at birth in a patient’s left arm became enlarged at age 2 and was resected and characterized as a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma. FISH and RT-PCR did not detect any common sarcoma translocations. A recurrence and a new mass formed after 4 months of therapy, so amputation was performed. Metastatic high-grade sarcoma appeared in the lungs 4 months later followed by multiple recurrences 10 months after treatment. Whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of diagnosis and normal samples were performed and the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact was discovered. Treatment with Crizotinib was started and a chest CT after 2 months revealed partial response. After 22 months of therapy, chest CT revealed a complete response of lung nodules, which has been sustained >18 months beyond the conclusion of treatment at 31 months.\n",
      "- ID 8902: A 40-year-old patient with a left calf mass revealed by biopsy to be a low grade myxoid spindle cell carcinoma underwent surgery and radiotherapy. Over a 5-year period, the patient experienced 3 lung metastases, which were all resected. At year 6, unresectable metastases were found in the lungs and lymph nodes. FISH and targeted next generation RNA sequencing of an earlier lung metastasis revealed and confirmed an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact. TRK inhibitor was administered and PET-CT scan revealed near complete response and no new lesions 1 year later.\n",
      "- ID 8903: The in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 11) with intact kinase domain was found and confirmed by next generation sequencing, RT-PCR, FISH, and/or immunohistochemistry in 3 Spitz neoplasm cases. Compared to controls (wildtype NTRK1 overexpression and GFP), lentiviral mediated overexpression of LMNA-NTRK1 in mouse melanocyte cells (melan-a) displayed increased phosphorylation of the fusion and downstream kinase targets, as assessed by Western Blot. Treatment with the NTRK1 inhibitor, AZ-23, quenched fusion and pathway activation. Additionally, injection of LMNA-NTRK1 melan-a cells into immunocompromised mice resulted in the rapid growth of tumors at the injection site within 40 days. Similar results were observed in mice injected with melan-a cells overexpressing NRAS G12V or HRAS G12V, but no tumors were observed in mice injected with GFP control melan-a cells.\n",
      "- ID 8904: A total of 140 Spitzoid neoplasm cases were analyzed by FISH and/or targeted DNA and RNA sequencing (n=38). Mutually exclusive kinase fusions were found in 72 cases. NTRK1 fusions were observed in 23 cases (8/75 Spitz naevi; 8/32 atypical Spitz tumors; 7/33 Spitzoid melanomas) and their expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. NTRK1 expression was absent in cases without a NTRK1 rearrangement. A 743kb deletion leading to the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 11) with the kinase domain intact was found in 3/38 NGS analyzed cases (1 nevus, 1 atypical, 1Spitzoid) and was verified by RT-PCR.\n",

      "- ID 10841: A frequent genetic alteration in congenital mesoblastic nephroma is the translocation t(12;15) resulting in a fusion of the ETV6 gene on 12p13 and the NTRK3 gene on 15p15 that occurs almost exclusively in cellular mesoblastic nephroma subtype.  In a group of 111 mesoblastic nephroma (MN) samples, 79 were were evaluable by FISH, which consisted of 38 classical MN, 29 cellular MN, and 12 mixed MN samples. 16 of 29 cellular type MN had ETV6::NTRK3 via break apart FISH, while 0/38 classical and 0/12 mixed types were positive.\n",
      "- ID 11880: This study evaluated the independent prognostic significance of pretreatment cytogenetics based on the large Medical Research Council (MRC) AML 10 trial which enrolled a total of 1,966 patients (364 children and 1,602 adults). All patients diagnosed with de novo AML (337 children and 1,460 adults) or secondary AML (22 children and 119 adults) received comparable therapy. The study concluded that patients with different cytogenetic abnormalities can be divided into 3 prognostic subgroups with favorable, intermediate, and adverse outcomes solely based on the results of cytogenetics. AML with t(8;21) [which results in RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion] was grouped together with AML with inv(16) [CBFB::MYH11 fusion] and t(15;17) [PML::RARA fusion] in the favorable group. The 122 patients with AML with t(8;21) had a 98% CR (complete remission) rate and 2% induction deaths. The observed prognostic associations further support that these abnormalities define clinically and biologically distinct AML subtypes.\n",
      "- ID 11882: The authors of this 1997 paper compared morphologic and cytochemical features between 30 acute myeloid leukemia subtype M2 (AML-M2) patients with t(8;21)  and  50 AML-M2 patients without t(8;21). Morphologic characteristics highly enriched in cases positive for t(8;21) included irregular nuclear shape, Auer bodies, at least 90% myeloperoxidase positivity in blast cells, pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly of the nuclei, and homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils. These features were observed in 90-100% of the t(8;21) positive cases and were rare in the t(8;21) negative group. Homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils was the most characteristic of t(8;21)positive AML-M2, while pale-colored cytoplasm without any granules in mature neutrophils or dyserythropoietic features was never observed in association with t(8;21). The study suggests association of the t(8;21) with a subtype of AML that has morphologically recognizable features in a high proportion of cases.  Of note, AML with t(8;21) translocation is now known to result in a RUNX1::RUNX1T fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11878: In this 1992 study, the authors isolated a clone containing the junction region of the (8;21)(q22;q22) translocation characteristic for acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21). Using probes from the junction clone, the presence of this consistent junction region was confirmed in 9 independent cases of AML with t(8;21). The authors also isolated cDNA clones from a t(8;21) AML cDNA library that contained fused sequences from chromosomes 8 and 21. This allowed them to identify the chromosome 8 partner gene which they named ETO (currently known as RUNX1T1) and confirm the chromosome 21 partner as AML1 (currently RUNX1), which showed similarity with the Drosophila segmentation gene, runt. The consequence of the t(8;21) was determined to be the juxtaposition of 5' sequences of AML1 (RUNX1) to 3' sequences of ETO (RUNX1T1), oriented telomere to centromere on the der(8) chromosome. The study confirms that t(8;21) consistently results in an oncogenic fusion between specific partner genes, confirming its role as a defining oncogenic abnormality in a subtype of AML.\n",
      "- ID 11879: The researchers analyzed immunophenotype in 30 cases of newly diagnosed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibiting M2 morphology per French-American-British classification. They correlated these findings with cytogenetic data. In 16 out of the 30 cases, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation or its variants were detected. The leukemias harboring t(8;21) did not significantly vary from other M2 cases regarding expression of various cell surface markers like CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD36, CD41a, CD42b, CDw65, TdT, or HLA-DR. However, the B-cell antigen CD19 expression was observed in 81% of t(8;21) cases compared to only 7% of non-t(8;21) M2 cases. Moreover, 63% of t(8;21) cases exhibited the NK-cell antigen CD56 expression versus 14% of non-t(8;21) M2 leukemias. Coexpression of CD19 and CD56 was exclusively found in the t(8;21) group. This coexpression pattern was absent in 48 cases of other AML subtypes lacking t(8;21). Additionally, non-t(8;21) M2 cases frequently expressed CD2 or CD7, while none of the t(8;21) cases did. The authors deduced that t(8;21) defines a biologically unique pediatric M2 AML subgroup with distinct immunophenotypic features differentiating it from other de novo AML types.\n",

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.\n",

Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy.\n",

IC50s were determined from immunoblots quantifying FLT3 phosphorylation in endogenous (Molm14) or ectopic expression FLT3-ITD cell lines (TF-1, Ba/F3) and the endogenous wildtype FLT3 SEMK2 cell line after gilteritinib treatment. IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib.

Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001).

Only one patient in this family developed symtoms, which included a brain stem hemangioblastoma and retinal angioma discovered at age 30. Parents of this individual showed no manifestations of VHL disease and were negative for bands via single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis where the proband showed extra bands. This study contains moderate evidence of pathogenicity because the protein length changes as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4).\n",

Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.  These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.\n",

      "- ID 10337: Molecular analysis of 30 Ewing tumors (designated as Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) in this 1994 paper) from patients with well-documented clinical course was performed.   RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28).  Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses.  19 of 28 (67%) were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex6 (type I), 4 of 28  (14%)  were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex5 (type II) and there was 1 each of EWSR1 ex7:: FLI1 ex7, EWSR1 ex 10::FLI1 ex 5, and EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4.  This last tumor (EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4) had evidence of an additional 4 splicing variants corresponding to EWSR1 exon 7 to FLI1 exons 4, 6, 8 and 9.  Two tumors had EWSR1::ERG with breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG.  Of note, karyotyping only revealed a chromosome 22 rearrangement in 18 out of 27 cases tested (67%), however this was thought to be due to failure to obtain mitotic figures (5 of 9) and insufficient  material (4 of 9).  Authors conclude RT-PCR is better than karyotyping for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors. In this small study, EWSR::FLI1 type I fusion predominated over type II in localized Ewing's and were more abundant in tumors affecting the long bones (9 versus 0), however no correlations between different EWSR1 transcripts and any other clinical parameters could be identified.\n",

Eleven CCSK cases were included in the study, from pediatric patients aged 2 - 8 years. Using RT-PCR, BCOR exon 15 ITDs were detected in 10/11 cases, with only 1 case, an 8-year-old male, found to be a double negative. The case was identified to have a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion by a NanoString-based sarcoma fusion assay, with exon 15 of BCOR fused to exon 5 of CCNB3, confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. CCNB3 immunoreactivity was identified in the BCOR::CCNB3 case and not in the BCOR ITD CCSK cases tested. The authors conclude this is the first report of a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion detected in a CCSK of a young child, with the same fusion typically seen in primary bone and soft tissue sarcomas of male adolescents, and that other cases of double negative CCSK require characterization.\n",
      "- ID 12004: In this 2020 study, the authors report two patients with BCOR::CCNB3 fusion-positive clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). Cases were males aged 10 and 14 years who presented with advanced disease. With initial testing, both cases were negative for a BCOR ITD. However, RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing were able to detect a BCOR::CCNB3 gene fusion. The authors concluded that all reports of CCSK with a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion have been detected in males older than the typical age (<4 years of age) of presentation for CCSK, and recommend testing for the BCOR::CCNB3 fusion in CCSK patients lacking a BCOR ITD or YWHAE::NUTM2 gene fusion.\n",
      "- ID 12005: In this 2017 study, the authors describe two primary renal sarcomas harboring BCOR::CCNB3 gene fusions and compare the morphological and immunochemical features to typical clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). The two tumors were diagnosed in males aged 11 and 12 years and were unclassified at diagnosis with overlapping features of CCSK and renal synovial sarcoma. The BCOR::CCNB3 gene fusion was detected by FISH in the two cases. Although these tumors were originally unclassified, with the molecular findings the cases were considered compatible with a CCSK diagnosis. The authors conclude there may be a “BCOR-alteration family” of renal and extra-renal neoplasms with overlapping clinicopathologic features.\n",
      "- ID 11539: A subset of renal neoplasms of children and young adults contains t(6;11)(p21;q12), fusion of the MALAT1 (Alpha) gene with the transcription factor gene TFEB. Argani, et al. (2005) included 7 renal neoplasms with cytogenetic and/or molecular evidence of the t(6;11)(p21;q12). The patients ranged from 9 to 33 years in age. All of the 7 renal neoplasms demonstrated either moderate or strong nuclear immunoreactivity for TFEB protein, and 1089 other neoplasms were tested but none showed significant labeling for TFEB. In 3 cases frozen tissue was available for RNA extraction, and RT-PCR detected the MALAT1(Alpha0::TFEB fusion. The potentially wide size range of MALAT1(Alpha)::TFEB fusion transcripts complicates the detection of this fusion by RT-PCR for robust detection in clinical RNA samples. The lack of splice signals in Alpha resulted in DNA PCR products of the same size as the RT-PCR products when the reverse primer binds to TFEB exon 3. The authors conclude that immunoreactivity for TFEB protein is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for these renal neoplasms and suggest that long-range DNA PCR may a useful alternative to RT-PCR due to the special molecular features of the Alpha::TFEB gene fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11535: Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) with t(6;11)(p21;q12) are extremely rare and are characterized by a specific chromosome translocation involving the transcription factor EB (TFEB). Identification of either overexpression of the TFEB protein or translocation is a useful method for the diagnosis of TFEB RCCs. However, the results of immunostainings can be inconsistent. This 2012 study included 7 genetically confirmed cases of this rare tumor. The patients’ ages ranged from 21 to 37 years.  All of these tumors showed moderate to strong immunoreactivity for TFEB. DNA PCR performed on genomic DNA extracted from FFPE tissue samples of the tumor identified the Alpha::TFEB fusion gene in 2 cases.  The TFEB partner gene MALAT1 (Alpha) is an intronless, untranslated (non-protein coding) gene of unknown function. The Alpha::TFEB fusion genes were not identified in the other 5 cases. Using a FISH split probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs showed a high percentage of cells with separation signals, and using a fusion probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs demonstrated fusion signals. They concluded that the diagnosis of such tumors should be based not only on morphology itself but also on immunophenotype and molecular genetic findings.\n",
      "- ID 11534: Bakouny, et al. (2022) performed a comprehensive study of the molecular and clinical features of translocation renal cell carcinomas (tRCCs), defined as subtype of kidney cancer driven by MiT/TFE gene fusions. Across the combined tRCC cohort, the majority of cases (78 cases; 88.6%) harbored TFE3 fusions, while the remainder harbored TFEB (8 cases; 9.1%) or MITF (2 cases; 2.3%) fusions.  Four different TFEB fusion partners were observed including CADM2, CLTC, COL21A1 and MALAT1. TFEB and MITF fusion partners tended to preserve less of the N-terminal fusion partner in the fusion product compared to TFE3. The authors conclude that most tRCCs harbor few somatic alterations apart from MiT/TFE fusions.\n",

The study included 13 tumors classified as pure SEF and six tumors from 4 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years. RNA-seq detected the EWSR1::CREB3L1 gene fusion in 8/13 pure SEF cases, with 2/13 positive for EWSR1::CREB3L2, and one each for FUS::CREM, FUS::CREB3L2, and PAX5::CREB3L1, while all hybrid tumors were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. SNP array showed both the pure SEF and hybrid tumors had multiple imbalances and structural rearrangements, and the authors suggest this could account for the poor outcome of SEF patients compared to LGFMS, which were found to be much less complex.\n",

A total of 18 cases included 10 cases of pure SEF and 8 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The overall mean age at diagnosis was 44 years (range 18–78). The pure SEF cases were found to have the well-known EWSR1::CREB3L1 fusion in 6/10 cases, a previously unidentified EWSR1::CREB3L2 fusion in 2/10 cases, a FUS rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10, and  an EWSR1 rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10 case.  On the other hand, the hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors all showed the presence of a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. The authors conclude identification of different fusions by gene-specific FISH probes can confirm differences underlying the histologically different pure SEF (mostly EWSR1 rearranged) from LGFMS variants (mainly FUS rearranged).\n",

Patients with SEF ranged from 28 to 91 years of age. Using RT-PCR, they detected in-frame fusions in 3/4 cases with suitable samples, joining either exon 7, 8, or 11 of EWSR1 to exon 6 of CREB3L1. Split signals at EWSR1 and CREB3L1 were detected by FISH in an additional case. All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement. The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.\n",

      "- ID 7125: Meningeal hemangiopericytoma (HPC) and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (MC) are aggressive neoplasms with overlapping clinical presentations and morphology. Thirteen FFPE samples of MC (9 females, 4 males) from ages 19 to 54 and Eighteen cases of meningeal HPC (8 females, 10 males) from ages from 24 to 73 years were tested using RT-PCR for the presence of HEY1-NCOA2 fusion. Of cases with evaluable RNA, 6/6 MC cases were positive for the fusion, but 0/11 meningeal HPC cases were fusion positive.\n",
      "- ID 7124: FISH was used to detect HEY1-NCOA2 fusions in 10 paraffin embedded samples from patients diagnosed with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. HEY1 and NCOA2 are located on the same chromosome but generate distinct FISH signals, whereas the HEY1-NCOA2 fusion appears as a single fused dot. Specimens were considered positive for fusion when FISH showed overlapping signals of HEY1 and NCOA2 in greater than 20% of the cells. Overlap signal of over 20% was seen in 8/10 patients. The two patients with no overlap signal were also negative for FISH staining, suggesting insufficient or damaged material for FISH.\n",
      "- ID 7017: 6 of 6 patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma and sufficient tissue tested positive for NCOA2 rearrangments by FISH supporting that NCOA2 rearrangements (presumably HEY1-NCOA2 translocations) are prevalent in this disease.\n",
      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",
      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",
      "- ID 10392: A pooled analysis of three phase 1/2 clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in 159 NTRK fusion positive solid tumor patients (1 month - 84 years old) confirmed larotrectinib to be effective and safe in these patients. NTRK2 fusions were found in 4 of the 159 patients. Two cases NTRK2 fusion cases were shown to have reduction in tumor size with another tumor showing only minor growth.\n",

      "- ID 8854: Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based technique acquired quantitative measurement of the effect of S249C on unliganded mutant FGFR3 dimer stability and structure in plasma membrane vesicles from CHO cells. Dimer stability was modestly increased by S249C (-3.7 kcal/mol) versus wildtype FGFR3 (-3.4 kcal/mol). Intrinsic FRET demonstrated S249C dimers were significantly closer together (45 A) than the wildtype dimer (53 A). The substitution of cysteine was expected to lead to strong covalent bonds, but the authors conclude their data demonstrates S249C does not induce constitutive FGFR3 dimerization, but induces dimer structural modifications.\n",
      "- ID 7941: NIH-3T3 cells with the FGFR3 S249C extracellular domain mutation demonstrated an increase in colony formation compared to wild-type in an anchorage-independence assay, which was counteracted by the treatment with AP24534 or BGJ398. Xenograft assays showed similar results with all transforming FGFR3 mutations leading to increased tumor growth compared to wild-type.\n",
      "- ID 8853: In contrast to controls (empty vector and FGFR3 wildtype overexpression NIH-3T3 cell lines), the stable transfection of NIH-3T3 cells with FGFR3b-S249C led to ligand-independent phosphorylation of FGFR3 and the acquisition of elongated, refractile spindle-shaped morphology like transformed cells. Using a thymidine incorporation assay, S249C expressing cells were shown to lose contact inhibition and grew 3x to 4x more rapidly than controls. Soft agar assays demonstrated increased colony formation and anchorage independent growth in S249C expressing cells versus controls. All nude mice subcutaneously injected with S249C cells rapidly formed tumors, but no tumors were observed in empty vector injected mice. The authors conclude mutated FGFR3b-S249C has transforming properties attributed to oncogenes.\n",

Western blot revealed the ratio of phosphorylated-Akt/total Akt was higher in the 97-7 cells than in the wild-type cells, which was reversed by siRNA knockdown of FGFR3. Inhibition of Akt signaling by treatment with GDC0068 or LY294002 increased the cisplatin sensitivity of 97-7 cells (IC50 4.17ug/ml & 8.91ug/ml respectively).\n",

Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop. This inhibitory mechanism allows for kinase inhibition to occur in the face of D835 mutation.\n",

Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy.\n",

He then received quizartinib and underwent allogenic transplant, but relapsed after 6 months. He then responded to sorafenib, but had disease progression with a FLT3-D835Y mutation. The patient derived relapse sample containing ITD and D835Y mutations was sensitive to gilteritinib based on cytotoxicity assays using MTT.

      "- ID 11777: Comprehensive molecular studies (through whole genome, whole exome, transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide copy number analysis, clustering analysis by DNA methylation profiling, mutation hotspot analysis by Sanger sequencing, and FISH) were performed in a cohort of 91 low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs), including diffuse astrocytomas, angiocentric gliomas, gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas. Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and no IDH mutations were detected in these tumors. MYB (n=5) or MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangement fusions were detected in 41% (7/17) of diffuse astrocytomas, while the remaining tumors had alternations involving BRAF (n = 4), FGFR1/3 (n = 4), and others (n = 2). The gene partners involving MYB fusions in diffuse astrocytomas included PCDHGA1, LOC154902, and MMP16 and the gene parterners involivng MYBL included MMP16. In contrast, a MYB fusion (most frequently MYB::QKI) characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (14–15). Only one other tumor across the series (an oligodendroglioma) had a MYB fusion (MYB::MAML2). MYB/MYBL-altered LGNTs clustered together with methylation profiling. The findings in LGNT with a predominantly astrocytic phenotype associating with MYB/MYBL alterations suggest a role of MYB/MYBL in these tumor categories with distinct characteristics.\n",
      "- ID 11778: The study compiled the clinicopathologic and molecular features of 46 gliomas with a MYB or MYBL1 alteration diagnosed at a single center. The tumors showed low-grade histopathologic features and were broadly classified as diffuse astrocytoma (n = 11) or angiocentric glioma (n=35). Molecular alterations interrogated by immunohistochemistry (n=46), RNA sequencing (n=29), FISH (n=24), or PCR-based sequencing (n=11) revealed MYB (n=44) or MYBL1 (n=2) alterations in all tumors. None had alterations in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, ATRX, or histone H3 genes. Regardless of histopathologic diagnosis or anatomic location, DNA methylome profiling on 35 MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas formed a single cluster, supporting that MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas represent a single disease entity with a range of clinical and pathologic characteristics. Of the 11 diffuse astrocytomas with MYB (n=9) and MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangements, 9 had identified gene partners, including PCDHGA1 (n=5), LOC154902 (n=1), MMP16 (n=1), and MAML2 (n=1) with MYB and MMP16 (n=1) with MYBL1.\n",
      "- ID 11790: A research study performed in 2010 involved 57 pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and a comparison group of 59 pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Among the LGG group, there were 34 cases of pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) and 23 cases of diffuse gliomas, which included fibrillary astrocytomas (DA, n=14), oligodendroglial tumors (n=7), and angiocentric gliomas (AG, n=2). The study utilized SNP arrays and FISH to detect MYB rearrangements and quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IMHC) to analyze MYB expression levels. Gains involving MYB and MYB amplifications that upregulate MYB RNA and protein expression were demonstrated in 2/14 diffuse astrocytomas (DAs). No MYB fusions were detected in the two DAs, but the sequence from one DA was found to terminate within MYB exon 9. In addition, the study revealed increased MYB expression in both AGs, with one AG showing a focal deletion in the 3' terminal region of MYB. Overall, increased MYB expression by RT-PCR was seen in 8 LGGs, including 5 DAs, 2 AGs, and 1 oligodendroglioma, and in all three cases with MYB copy number aberrations. IMHC revealed an increase in MYB expression at the protein level in 60% of LGGs including 41% of PAs, and 19% of HGGs. Notably, genomic abnormalities were exclusively observed in diffuse gliomas. The findings suggest that MYB dysregulation may contribute to pediatric gliomas, particularly in diffuse gliomas, through various mechanisms beyond amplification and deletion.\n",
      "- ID 11776: Histological, molecular, and clinical analysis of 26 histologically prototypical isomorphic diffuse gliomas with a specific DNA methylation profile distinct from other glial/glio-neuronal brain tumors and normal hemispheric tissue were found to be most closely related to pediatric MYB/MYBL1-altered diffuse astrocytomas and angiocentric gliomas. IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing data demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Three tumors had MYB fusions with the gene partners, including HMG20A (n=1) and PCDHGA1 (n=2). These gene fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain and/or a loss of the negative regulatory 3' miRNA-binding sites with an associated increase in MYB expression. Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYB in 3 tumors, including one tumor with gains involving both MYB and HMG20A resulting in two different MYB::HMG20A fusions and two tumors without MYB fusions detected. Increased MYB expression was observed in four (4/6) tumors\n",
      "- ID 12009: RNA sequencing identified NUTM1 fusions in six patients with primary undifferentiated soft tissue and visceral tumors.  Fusions included BRD4::NUTM1 (three cases), BRD3::NUTM1, MXD1::NUTM1, and BCORL1::NUTM1, however only the BRD4::NUTM1 and BRD3::NUTM1 cases were positive for NUTM1 IHC.   Independent testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of the NUTM1 and partner gene rearrangement.  The breakpoints were located at NUTM1 exon 3 or 5 (NM_001284292.1) and BRD4 exon 11 (NM_058243.2) or BRD3 exon 9 (NM_007371.3). Despite some overlap with NUT midline carcinoma, the authors note that the tumors observed also differed in several ways, tentatively labeled these malignant neoplasms as \"NUT-associated tumors\", and speculate that they might represent an overarching category that also includes NUT midline carcinoma.\n",
      "- ID 12050: In this 2020 study, the authors included a total of 141 NUT carcinomas defined by rearrangement of NUTM1 detected by IHC, cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The median age at diagnosis was 24 years (range of 18 days to 80 years). Fusion partners were confirmed by either cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The majority  (78%) of tumors harbored a BRD4::NUTM1 fusion, 15% harbored a BRD3::NUTM1  fusion, 6% harbored a NSD3::NUTM1 fusion, 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF532::NUTM1 fusion and 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF592::NUTM1 fusion. For the remaining 14 cases the fusion partner gene to NUTM1 was not identified. The majority of tumors arose from the thorax or head and neck, but tumors were also seen in bone, soft tissue, and kidney. Outcomes in patients were overall poor, however, the authors conclude that they have identified three clinically and molecularly defined prognostic risk groups: group A is nonthoracic, BRD3::NUTM1, or NSD3::NUTM1 with a significantly improved prognosis (OS of 36.5 months); group B is nonthoracic, BRD4::NUTM1 with a poor prognosis (OS of 10 months); and group C is thoracic with a very poor prognosis (OS of 3.5 to 5.6 months) regardless of the NUTM1 fusion partner.\n",
      "- ID 12049: In this 2017 study, the authors sought to characterize NUT carcinomas. They included a cohort of 12 aggressive malignant tumors with rearrangement of the NUTM1 gene, assessed by RT-PCR, FISH, positive nuclear NUTM1 immunohistochemistry, and/or t(15; 19) detection by cytogenetics. The median age at onset was 18 years (with a range of 12 –50 years). RT-PCR or FISH confirmed the fusion partner as BRD4 in 9 of 12 cases, and a finding of t(15;19) (q13;p13) by cytogenetics confirmed BRD4 as the partner in 1 case.  All cases tested had positive anti-NUTM1 antibody immunostaining. The primary tumor was found to be lateralized in two-thirds of the cases, rather than localized to the midline, supporting the change in name from \"NUT midline carcinoma\" to \"NUT carcinoma\". The authors state that 50% of cases initially had an alternative diagnosis and recommend NUTM1-specific antibody immunostaining in cases of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinoma to properly diagnose NUT carcinoma at an earlier stage.\n",
      "- ID 12051: In this 2004 study, the authors sought to identify carcinomas with translocation t(15;19)(q13, p13.1), which results in the novel oncogenic fusion BRD4::NUTM1 (described as NUT). The authors screened malignant tumors with epithelial differentiation, in patients less than 40 years of age, with poorly differentiated histomorphology, rapid clinical progression, and/or cytogenetic evidence of chromosome 15q or 19p rearrangement. In total, using FISH with dual-color assays evaluating chromosome 19p13.1 BRD4 and 15q13 NUTM1 breakpoints, they detected 11 tumors to have a NUTM1 rearrangement, with 7 of the cases detected in 98 previously unscreened samples and the others in known positive cases. Patients with a NUTM1 rearrangement ranged from 3 to 35 years of age. The NUTM1 rearrangement was consistent with BRD4::NUTM1 in 8/11 cases and 3/11 were found to have a rearrangement of NUTM1 but not BRD4, suggesting the existence of other rearrangements involving NUTM1 which the authors designate NUT-variant carcinomas. The authors conclude that NUTM1 rearranged carcinomas can arise from various midline epithelial surfaces and are associated with poor outcome.\n",
      "- ID 12060: In this 2014 study, the authors compared 10 primary sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas (SEF), 4 cases of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), and one primary hybrid SEF/LGFMS. Patients with LGFMS ranged from 22 to 53 years of age.  All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement.  EWSR1::CREB3L1 was detected in SEF.  The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF while FUS::CREB3L2 is common in LGFMS, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.\n",
      "- ID 12062: In this study, an RT-PCR assay detected a FUS::CREB3L2 transcript in 14 of 16 (88%) low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) cases, whereas the fusion was not detected in any of the 123 other soft-tissue tumors (including desmoid-type fibromatoses, myxofibrosarcomas, soft-tissue perineuriomas, and congenital or adult fibrosarcomas). Patients ages ranged from 13 to 58 years. The fusion product involved exon 6 of FUS and exon 5 of CREB3L2 in the majority of cases. This supports FUS::CREB3L2 detection as a reliable approach to accurately diagnose LGFMS.\n",
      "- ID 12061: RT-PCR analysis of 59 low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas (LGFMS) and 52 non-LGFMS tumors selected for their resemblance to LGFMS (LGFMS-like tumors), identified a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion in 45 cases, a FUS::CREB3L1 in 3 cases, and no fusion in 11 cases of LGFMS. FUS exon 6 and CREB3L2 exon 5 were most frequently rearranged. Median age at LGFMS diagnosis was 35 years (range 11 to 75 years). 7 of 52 non-LGMFS neoplasms contained a FUS-CREB3L2 fusion with 4 of these diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, a sarcoma known to have molecular and morphological overlap with LGMFS.  The presence of these FUS fusions and the histology may be helpful in diagnosis.\n",

      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",
      "- ID 1279: In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.\n",
      "- ID 8657: A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).\n",

      "- ID 1: Sylvester Samuels better known by his stage name Lil Ru, is an American rapper from Ridgeway, South Carolina currently signed to Def Jam Recordings.  His debut album, 21 & Up was released on August 25, 2009.  The Ridgeway native was 16 when he made his professional foray into the music business.  Inspired by New Orleans’ innovative Cash Money Crew, Ru began making a name for himself on his local music scene, doing live shows and pressing up his own CDs.  His hard-hitting lyrics and entrepreneurial spirit caught the attention of fellow South Carolinian Angie Stone.  Shortly after the neo-soul songstress helped him secure a deal with Elektra Records, Ru found himself unsigned again, among the artists lost in the shuffle after the label merged with Atlantic Records.  Music fans first heard him on his 2001 debut single Will Destroy.  He then released his 2002 follow up, Shawty What You Doin’.

      "Claim: The English local newspaper featuring the Forbury Gardens sculpture and war memorial changed its name in 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence List:\n",
      "- ID 107: The Reading Post (until 2009, the Reading Evening Post), was an English local newspaper covering Reading, Berkshire and surrounding areas.  The title page of the paper featured the Maiwand Lion, a famous local landmark at Forbury Gardens.  The paper was most recently published by Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd., a division of Trinity Mirror plc.\n",
      "- ID 108: St James's Church is a Roman Catholic church situated in the centre of the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.  It is located adjacent to the remaining ruins of Reading Abbey, between the Forbury Gardens and Reading Gaol.\n",
      "- ID 109: The York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England.  Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial.  Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose.  Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument.  The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York.  Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials.  Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's.  Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.  This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.\n",
      "- ID 110: Spalding War Memorial is a First World War memorial in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall (pronounced ) in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in eastern England.  It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.  The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war.  She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross.  The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council.  When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested.  After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building.\n",
      "- ID 111: The Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire.  The statue was named after the Battle of Maiwand and was erected in 1884 to commemorate the deaths of 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot during the campaign in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan between 1878 and 1880.  It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion.\n",
      "- ID 112: Kargil War Memorial, also known as the Vijaypath, is a war memorial built by the Indian Army, located in Dras, in the foothills of the Tololing Hill.  The memorial is located about 5 km from the city centre across the Tiger Hill.  It is located on the Srinagar-Leh National Highway 1D.  The memorial is in the memory of the soldiers and officers of the Indian Army who were killed during the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan.  The conflict later became known as the \"Kargil War\".  The memorial has a huge epitaph with names of all the officers and soldiers who died in war.  Kargil Vijay Diwas is celebrated on 26 July every year at the memorial simultaneously the Prime Minister of India pays tribute to the soldiers at Amar Jawan Jyothi at the India Gate, New Delhi. The main attraction of the whole memorial is the Sandstone wall, in the open, which has the names of all the Indian army personnel, who laid their lives during the Kargil war besides there is also a souvenir shop.  Visitors to the memorial can also see from there, some of the peaks that the Indian army captured back from Pakistan.  A giant national flag, weighing 15 kg was hoisted at the Kargil war memorial to commemorate the 13th anniversary of India’s victory in the war\n",
      "- ID 113: Manchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square in Manchester, England.  Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities—the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922.  The committee quickly raised £10,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial.  The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community.  The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church.  Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ.\n",
      "- ID 114: Forbury Gardens is a public park in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.  The park is on the site of the outer court of Reading Abbey, which was in front of the Abbey Church.  The site was formerly known as the Forbury, and one of the roads flanking the current gardens is still known as The Forbury.  Fairs were held on the site three times a year until the 19th century.\n",
      "- ID 115: The Devon County War Memorial is a First World War memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and situated on the cathedral green in Exeter, the county town of Devon, in the south west of England.  It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city.  The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds.  After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead.  The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations.  A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials—the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens.\n",
      "- ID 116: The Forbury Hotel (formerly Shire Hall) is a grade II listed hotel in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.  It is situated on the southern side of Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town centre.\n",

The islands were known to the Norse as the \"Suðreyjar\", or \"Southern Isles\" as distinct from the \"Norðreyjar\" or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland.  The historical record is incomplete and the kingdom was probably not a continuous entity throughout the entire period.  The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the \"Kingdom of Mann and the Isles\", although only some of the later rulers claimed that title.  At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney.

He was a son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle.  Aonghus Mór appears to have succeeded his father in the mid part of the thirteenth century.  At the time, the rulers of the Isles were fiercely independent of the Scottish Crown, and owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown.  Aonghus Mór's first certain appearance in the historical record seems to evince his involvement in aiding native Irish kindreds against the consolidation of Anglo-Irish authority in the north-west Ireland.  Such cooperation could have been undertaken in the context of overseas kindreds like Clann Domhnaill constructing Irish alliances to gain assistance against Scottish encroachment.\n",

Matches and practices are held at Noonday Creek Park in Marietta.  Coach Randall Joseph has been the head coach since the club's founding, with Anthony \"Bubba\" Gautney as assistant coach.  The club has taken park in many tournaments and state final matches in Georgia and the Southeast United States.  A major goal of the Trojans Rugby Football Club is to teach and play the sport of rugby in the United States.  This is a great struggle throughout Georgia because of opposition from the high school's football coaches and athletic directors.  The club plays the most common version of rugby, called rugby union but often just referred to as rugby.  Although the club plays by rugby union rules, they also play by the rules of the International Rugby Board (IRB) for those under 19 years of age.  In the summer of 2011, the Trojan Rugby Football Club took part in another version of rugby called rugby sevens.

      "- ID 139: Maxine's Tap Room is a historic bar in Fayetteville, Arkansas, located on 107 N. Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas.  Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents.  She managed to pay her parents back within the year.  In 1960 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building—a long, narrow brick structure—built in its place.  The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 in by 40 in , in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time.  This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins.  Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success.  Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50 ft -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie.  Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000.  She died at age 82 in May 2006.  A month later the Tap Room caught fire.  Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007.  Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar.  The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through.  Considerable efforts were made to retain many things that had been in the bar for a very long time, such as the older lights and signs.\n",

      "Evidence List:\n",
      "- ID 148: Chronic Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma.  These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma.  Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood.  These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV).  Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age.  HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development.  In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma.  Thus, \"Chlamydia pneumoniae\", \"Mycoplasma pneumoniae\" and human rhinoviruses are microbes that play a major role in non-atopic asthma.\n",
