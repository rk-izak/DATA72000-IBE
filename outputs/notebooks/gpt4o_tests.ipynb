      "- ID 1122: HERA was a Phase III trial assessing application of trastuzumab in an extended adjuvant setting.  Patients were HER2 positive with completely excised invasive BC, node positive or negative, and having undergone prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.  In the 3 arm study patients were given trastuzumab courses of 1 year, 2 years, or untreated.  At the first planned interim analysis, trastuzumab treatment for one year was compared with observation alone.  A significant difference in disease-free survival was seen with 220 DFS events out of 1693 in the observation arm versus 127 DFS events out of 1694 in the 1 year trastuzumab arm.  1 year adjuvant trastuzumab is currently the standard of care.\n",
      "- ID 529: A randomized clinical trial of 186 patients with previously untreated, HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer demonstrated improved overall survival, response rate, response duration, time to progression, and time to treatment failure for patients who received trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy (docetaxel) compared to chemotherapy alone.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ERBB2 Amplification\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The claim that HER2 amplification predicts sensitivity to Trastuzumab is supported by multiple clinical trials demonstrating improved outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancer patients treated with Trastuzumab. Evidence from trials such as HERA and others show significant improvements in disease-free survival and overall survival when Trastuzumab is added to chemotherapy, indicating that HER2 amplification is a key factor in predicting treatment response. The biological mechanism underlying this relationship is the overexpression of the HER2 protein, which Trastuzumab targets effectively, leading to better treatment outcomes. However, the complexity of breast cancer treatment suggests that while HER2 amplification is a strong predictor, other factors may also influence sensitivity to Trastuzumab, and alternative therapies may be needed for cases where resistance develops. Overall, the evidence coherently supports the claim, fitting well within the existing body of knowledge on HER2-positive breast cancer treatment.\"\n",

CNS disease) were randomized to reiceive either Alectinib or Crizotinib. During a median follow-up of 17.6 months (crizotinib) and 18.6 months (alectinib), an event of disease progression/death occurred in 41% (62/152  pt) in the alectinib group and 68% (102/151 patients) in the crizotinib group. 12-month event-free survival rate 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib. A total of 18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an event of CNS progression, compared to 68 patients (45%) in the crizotinib group.

      "- ID 1200: This retrospective study of patients from the PROFILE 1001 and 1005 studies of crizotinib in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC assessed the potential benefit of crizotinib beyond progressive disease (CBPD), defined as continuation of crizotinib for 3 or more weeks after disease progression on crizotinib. 194 patients who had developed PD by data cutoff were studied, where 120 received crizotinib for a median duration of 19.4 weeks and 74 discontinued crizotinib after PD. No gross imbalances in clinicopathologic features of the two groups were evident.  Significantly longer overall survival was observed in the crizotinib continuing group from time of PD (16.4 vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17–0.42; P < 0.0001), and from the time of initial crizotinib (29.6 vs. 10.8 months; HR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19–0.46; P < 0.0001).\n",

      "- ID 1187: In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.\n",
      "- ID 1207: In the PROFILE 1001 study of crizotinib in 82 patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, 31 patients with sufficient tumor material were tested using RT-PCR for the presence of certain EML4-ALK variants.  13/31 tested patients had the EML4-ALK variant 1. Of these, 12/13 had a partial response, and 1 had stable disease. This response rate of 92% is in contrast to the 57% response rate in the overall patient population, but the numbers of patients with specific EML4-ALK breakpoints were insufficient to correlate with patient response rate.\n",

Morphology and immunohistochemistry were unable to establish the primary tumor site. Right upper extremity (RUE), scalp, and multiple lung lesions were apparent. A lung lesion sample with sufficient material for molecular profiling was not attainable but sufficient material was present from the RUE for hybrid capture genomic profiling  (FoundationOne kit was used). EML4-ALK variant 3 was found, and the patient was started on crizotinib. Rapid symptom improvement was seen. After 1 month, a CT scan showed significant size reduction in lung tumors, and after 5 months the patient was asymptomatic with an entirely negative examination.\n",
      "- ID 1189: In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.\n",
      "- ID 1196: EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) were expressed in Ba/F3 cells using retrovirus.  While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 1190: Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.\n",
      "- ID 1193: In a set of 31 patients with NSCLC, RT-PCR was performed to test for known EML4-ALK variants.  Five patients tested positive for the 3a/3b EML4-ALK variant.  Of these, 4 had partial response (PR), and one had disease progression (DP), and this was the only DP in the group of 31.  In contrast, of the 13 testing positive for EML4-ALK variant 1, 12 showed PR, and 1 showed stable disease.  These results potentially mirror findings in the H2228 3a/3b containing NSCLC cell line where some literature indicates it does respond as strongly to ALK inhibition as other EML4-ALK NSCLC cell lines.\n",
      "- ID 1356: In Ba/F3 cells, crizotinib sensitivty of the NPM-ALK variant was compared to crizotinib sensitivity of EML4-ALK variant 3. 50% of maximal inhibitory concentration for NPM-ALK was 42 nM, which was approximately 4x greater than IC50 of 11 nM obtained for EML4-ALK. The IC50 for parental Ba/F3 supplemented with IL3 was 2299 nM, resulting in a fold difference of 209.2 for EML4-ALK and 55.1 for NPM-ALK, indicating some reduced sensitivity for NPM-ALK in direct comparison to EML4-ALK, but substantial sensitization to crizotinib for NPM-ALK in Ba/F3 cells.\n",
      "- ID 1197: Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) showed differential sensitivity to both crizotinib and TAE684, with variant 3a (E6;A20) being the least sensitive. The authors suggest that the type/structure of ALK fusion may have some impact on patient outcome in targeted therapy.\n",
      "- ID 262: A 28 year-old patient with non-small cell lung cancer that failed conventional therapy was found to harbor the EML4-ALK (E13;A20) fusion using reverse transcription PCR. Treatment with 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulted in rapid improvement of symptoms and disease control for 5 months.\n",
      "- ID 1198: This two arm Phase III study named PROFILE 1007 (NCT00932893) was performed to assess crizotinib vs. established chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients positive for ALK rearrangement (assessed by break-apart FISH) with locally advanced or metastatic disease. 347 patients with disease progression after one round of platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive crizotinib (N=173) or chemotherapy (N=174) consisting of pemetrexed in pemetrexed-naive patients and docetaxel for patients previously treated with pemetrexed. The primary endpoint - progression free survival (PFS) - was found to be significantly better for patients treated with crizotinib (median 7.7 months) than with chemotherapy (median 3.0 months) (hazard ratio for disease progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001). Response rates were 65% for crizotinib treatment and 20% for chemotherapy (P<0.001). Improvements in quality of life were also reported.\n",
      "- ID 1199: This phase 3 trial named PROFILE 1014 (NCT01154140) compared crizotinib to established chemotherapy in first-line treatment for this disease. The study consisted of 343 patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC that tested positive for ALK rearrangement via break-apart FISH assay, and had no prior systemic treatment. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to crizotinib (N=172) or pemetrexed with cisplatin or carboplatin (N=171). Progression free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (10.9 vs. 7.0 months; hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.60;P<0.001), and objective response rate was higher with crizotinib treatment than chemotherapy (75% vs. 45%, P<0.001). Improvement in quality of life was also reported.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy.

Clinical studies, such as the Phase 1/2 trials (ID 6569 and ID 6567), demonstrate high response rates in patients with NTRK1 fusions treated with Larotrectinib, with significant tumor regression observed in a majority of cases. Molecular evidence (ID 978 and ID 1019) further corroborates this by showing that NTRK1 fusions lead to constitutive kinase activity, making them susceptible to TRKA inhibitors like Larotrectinib. Additionally, the selectivity and efficacy of TRK inhibitors, as shown in studies involving LOXO-101 (ID 2953 and ID 2955), reinforce the hypothesis by illustrating consistent therapeutic responses across different tumor types harboring NTRK fusions.

The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.\n",

ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib.

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

IC50s were determined from immunoblots quantifying FLT3 phosphorylation in endogenous (Molm14) or ectopic expression FLT3-ITD cell lines (TF-1, Ba/F3) and the endogenous wildtype FLT3 SEMK2 cell line after gilteritinib treatment. IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib. Additionally, plasma taken from 3 patients receiving 120mg of gilteritinib daily was able to inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation in Molm14 cells.\n",
      "- ID 8924: In vitro gilteritinib treatment of MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells, which endogenously express FLT3-ITD, showed growth suppression based on CellTiter GLO cytotoxicity assays with IC50 values of 0.92 nM (95% CI: 0.23–3.6 nM) and 2.9 nM (95% CI: 1.4–5.8 nM), respectively. Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15. Gilteritinib treated mice showed significantly less widespread disease at day 42 than control counterparts (N=10, p<0.001) and significantly improved survival (log-rank, p<0.001).\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.\n",

Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).\n",

RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",

Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",

Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ABL1 SNX2::ABL1\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",
      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",

      "- ID 8854: Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based technique acquired quantitative measurement of the effect of S249C on unliganded mutant FGFR3 dimer stability and structure in plasma membrane vesicles from CHO cells. Dimer stability was modestly increased by S249C (-3.7 kcal/mol) versus wildtype FGFR3 (-3.4 kcal/mol). Intrinsic FRET demonstrated S249C dimers were significantly closer together (45 A) than the wildtype dimer (53 A). The substitution of cysteine was expected to lead to strong covalent bonds, but the authors conclude their data demonstrates S249C does not induce constitutive FGFR3 dimerization, but induces dimer structural modifications.\n",

Xenograft assays showed similar results with all transforming FGFR3 mutations leading to increased tumor growth compared to wild-type.\n",
      "- ID 8853: In contrast to controls (empty vector and FGFR3 wildtype overexpression NIH-3T3 cell lines), the stable transfection of NIH-3T3 cells with FGFR3b-S249C led to ligand-independent phosphorylation of FGFR3 and the acquisition of elongated, refractile spindle-shaped morphology like transformed cells. Using a thymidine incorporation assay, S249C expressing cells were shown to lose contact inhibition and grew 3x to 4x more rapidly than controls. Soft agar assays demonstrated increased colony formation and anchorage independent growth in S249C expressing cells versus controls. All nude mice subcutaneously injected with S249C cells rapidly formed tumors, but no tumors were observed in empty vector injected mice. The authors conclude mutated FGFR3b-S249C has transforming properties attributed to oncogenes.\n",

Western blot revealed the ratio of phosphorylated-Akt/total Akt was higher in the 97-7 cells than in the wild-type cells, which was reversed by siRNA knockdown of FGFR3.

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The claim that ETV6::NTRK3 is an oncogenic fusion in multiple cancer types is supported by evidence from a study where patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers, including those with ETV6-NTRK3 fusions, showed significant responses to targeted therapy with larotrectinib. Specifically, in a cohort of patients with various solid tumors, those harboring TRK fusions, such as ETV6-NTRK3, demonstrated a high rate of objective responses, contrasting with the lack of response in TRK fusion-negative patients. This evidence suggests that the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and is a valid target for therapy, fitting well within the broader context of cancer research that identifies genetic fusions as key oncogenic drivers. However, the evidence set lacks direct comparison with other oncogenic fusions, and further studies could enhance the understanding of its unique role across different cancer types.\"\n",

      "Evidence List:\n",
      "- ID 529: A randomized clinical trial of 186 patients with previously untreated, HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer demonstrated improved overall survival, response rate, response duration, time to progression, and time to treatment failure for patients who received trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy (docetaxel) compared to chemotherapy alone.\n",

      "Additional Information:\n",
      "- Molecular Profile: ERBB2 Amplification\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The claim that HER2 amplification predicts sensitivity to Trastuzumab is supported by evidence from multiple randomized clinical trials, which demonstrate improved outcomes for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer receiving Trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy. Specifically, trials with 186 and 469 patients showed enhanced overall survival, response rates, and time to disease progression when Trastuzumab was added to chemotherapy. This aligns with the background knowledge that HER2 amplifications are associated with aggressive breast cancer, and Trastuzumab has been effective in treating HER2-positive cases. However, the evidence also indicates that while Trastuzumab is initially effective, resistance can develop, necessitating additional therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This suggests that while HER2 amplification is a predictor of initial sensitivity to Trastuzumab, the relationship is complex, and ongoing research into combination therapies is crucial for sustained treatment efficacy.\"\n",

Of these, 12/13 had a partial response, and 1 had stable disease.

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

Evidence from phase III trials, such as PROFILE 1014, shows that crizotinib significantly improves progression-free survival and response rates compared to chemotherapy in ALK-positive NSCLC patients (ID 1199). Additionally, the PROFILE 1001 study highlights a 57% overall response rate to crizotinib, with a notably higher response rate in patients with specific EML4-ALK variants (ID 1187, ID 1207). However, the variability in sensitivity among different EML4-ALK variants, as seen in Ba/F3 cell studies (ID 1196), suggests that the type of ALK fusion may influence treatment outcomes. Despite these differences, the overall evidence consistently supports the efficacy of crizotinib in treating ALK-rearranged NSCLC, aligning with established oncological principles and reinforcing the claim's validity.\"\n",

This variant disrupts the VHL gene's function by impairing its binding to elongin C, which reduces the VHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) E3 ligase complex levels, leading to dysregulation of HIF2\\u03b1 and increased tumorigenesis risk.

The study in Evidence ID 4846 demonstrates increased phospho-SMAD1/5/8 signaling and mRNA expression of downstream proteins in DIPG cells with ACVR1 mutations, suggesting a distinct molecular pathway activation associated with this tumor type. Evidence ID 6955 further corroborates this by showing that the ACVR1 G328V mutation enhances BMP signaling and cell growth in immortalized astrocytes, indicating its role in tumorigenesis. The recurrence of these mutations in DIPG and their absence in other gliomas strengthen the claim, providing a coherent and compelling argument for the diagnosis of DIPG based on genetic and molecular evidence.\"\n",

      "The evidence from the studies aligns with existing knowledge that combination therapy with BRAF inhibitors (like dabrafenib or vemurafenib) and MEK inhibitors (like trametinib or cobimetinib) is more effective than BRAF inhibitor monotherapy in treating BRAF V600E mutant melanoma. The studies consistently show improved progression-free survival and response rates with combination therapy compared to monotherapy, which is consistent with the understanding that MEK inhibitors can help overcome resistance mechanisms associated with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy. The hazard ratios for progression or death in the combination therapy groups are significantly lower, indicating a substantial benefit. An alternative hypothesis might consider the role of other genetic mutations or pathways that could influence treatment response, as suggested by the post-hoc sequencing in one study that found mutations other than BRAF V600E.

      "In the Phase III trial (ID 6965), patients with the BRAF V600K mutation treated with vemurafenib and cobimetinib showed a lower event rate (4 of 24) compared to those on monotherapy (17 of 32), with the median progression-free survival not met for the combination group. When considering all V600 mutations, the median progression-free survival with combination treatment was 9.9 months. The hazard ratio for progression or death was significantly lower at 0.27, indicating a strong benefit of the combination therapy over monotherapy. These results suggest that the V600K mutation responds well to the combination therapy, supporting the claim of specific sensitivity of V600K mutant melanoma to this treatment. The significant reduction in progression or death risk implies that the combination therapy is particularly effective for V600K mutations, validating its use in this subgroup.\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The claim that BRAF V600K mutant melanoma is sensitive to vemurafenib and cobimetinib combination therapy is supported by evidence from multiple studies. In the coBRIM Phase III trial (ID 6965), patients with the V600K mutation treated with the combination therapy showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to those receiving vemurafenib monotherapy, with a hazard ratio of 0.27, indicating a substantial reduction in the risk of progression or death. This aligns with findings from other studies (ID 6940) where combination therapies involving BRAF and MEK inhibitors improved outcomes for patients with BRAF mutations, including V600K. Although the majority of evidence focuses on V600E mutations, the observed benefits in V600K patients suggest that the combination therapy is effective for this mutation as well. However, the evidence is less robust for V600K compared to V600E, indicating a need for further research to confirm these findings specifically for V600K mutations.\"\n",

Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood.

      "The presence of the VHL E70K variant in multiple unrelated individuals with VHL disease symptoms, coupled with its absence in control populations, supports its pathogenicity by demonstrating a significant association between the variant and the disease (ACMG code: PS4). This association is further strengthened by the variant's cosegregation with the disease in multiple affected family members, indicating a consistent pattern of inheritance in families known to have VHL disease (ACMG code: PP1). However, potential limitations include the lack of screening in additional family members in some cases, which could provide more comprehensive evidence of inheritance patterns. Additionally, the study's reliance on a relatively small sample size of control cases may not fully capture the variant's prevalence in the general population.

      "The clinical manifestations associated with the VHL E70K variant, such as CNS hemangioblastomas, retinal hemangioblastomas, and renal cell carcinoma, align well with the known phenotypic characteristics of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. The presence of these symptoms in multiple family members, as seen in the case reports, supports the genetic basis of the disease, consistent with the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of VHL. The cosegregation of the E70K variant with the disease in affected family members further corroborates its pathogenic role. While the data strongly suggest a genetic etiology, the possibility of alternative genetic or environmental factors is not explicitly addressed in the context provided. However, the consistent presence of the E70K variant in affected individuals across different families suggests that it is a primary driver of the observed phenotypes, rather than alternative factors.\n",

Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood.

This missense mutation was found in a VHL type 1 patient and two VHL type 2B patients (patient no. V322, V36, V262). This study contains strong evidence of pathogenicity for this variant because the prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence In controls (ACMG code: PS4). No additional family members were screened in all 3 cases.\n",
      "- ID 5426: 43 unrelated VHL patients with previously sequenced VHL germline mutations and 36 suspected VHL mutation carriers were subject to denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) mutation screening. This mutation was found in 2  previously diagnosed VHL patients and a suspect VHL mutation carrier by DHPLC (family VHL 26, VHL 63, VHL 77). This variant results in an in frame deletion providing moderate evidence for pathogenicity (PM4).\n",
      "- ID 5203: In a study of 426 unrelated VHL patients, 111 were discovered to have alterations in the VHL gene. 18 novel variants were identified in VHL patients, but none were present in 200 unaffected control individuals. This deletion mutation was found in a 25 yr old VHL patient with multiple pancreatic cysts and hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system (index case 280). This study contains moderate support for pathogenicity because the protein length changes as a result changes as a result of in-frame deletions in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4).\n",
      "- ID 5750: This study reports 1,548 germline and somatic mutations from 945 VHL families. Mutation was detected in a VHL kindred with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, retinal hemangioblastomas and Grawitz tumor (also known as RCC) (case no. 2034). Protein length changes as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4). Patient's phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology (ACMG code: PP4).\n",

Only one patient in this family developed symtoms, which included a brain stem hemangioblastoma and retinal angioma discovered at age 30. Parents of this individual showed no manifestations of VHL disease and were negative for bands via single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis where the proband showed extra bands. This study contains moderate evidence of pathogenicity because the protein length changes as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4).\n",

Follow-up of families with germline mutations and limited VHL manifestations was recommended. This mutation was found in 2 family members with retinal hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinoma (family no. 25). One family member also had central nervous system hemangioblastoma.

      "The prognostic implications of BRAF V600E mutations in colorectal cancer are generally more severe compared to KRAS mutations. In the MRC COIN trial, patients with BRAF variants had a median overall survival of 8.8 months, which is significantly lower than the 14.4 months for those with KRAS variants and 20.1 months for wildtype patients. This indicates that BRAF V600E mutations are associated with poorer outcomes. Additionally, in the CRYSTAL Phase III Trial, BRAF V600E tumors had worse outcomes compared to BRAF wildtype, even when treated with cetuximab.

Evidence from the CRYSTAL Phase III Trial (ID 7157) and the MRC COIN trial (ID 7158) shows that patients with BRAF V600E mutations have significantly shorter median overall survival compared to those with wildtype BRAF, highlighting the mutation's association with worse outcomes.

      "The potential limitations or challenges in using FISH to detect HEY1::NCOA2 fusions in mesenchymal chondrosarcoma include the quality and integrity of the sample material. As seen in the context, two patients showed no overlap signal and were negative for FISH staining, likely due to insufficient or damaged material, which can lead to false negatives. Additionally, the requirement for more than 20% of cells to show overlapping signals for a positive result may miss cases with lower fusion prevalence.

Of 69 patients with measurable disease, 35 achieved objective response, with median duration of response 13.5 months. Of 16 patients with measurable CNS disease, four achieved CNS complete response and 8 showed CNS partial response. median duration of CNS response was 11.1 months. 2 deaths were observed, and 1 was judged related to study treatment.\n",
      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib. Additionally, plasma taken from 3 patients receiving 120mg of gilteritinib daily was able to inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation in Molm14 cells.\n",
      "- ID 8924: In vitro gilteritinib treatment of MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells, which endogenously express FLT3-ITD, showed growth suppression based on CellTiter GLO cytotoxicity assays with IC50 values of 0.92 nM (95% CI: 0.23–3.6 nM) and 2.9 nM (95% CI: 1.4–5.8 nM), respectively. Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15. Gilteritinib treated mice showed significantly less widespread disease at day 42 than control counterparts (N=10, p<0.001) and significantly improved survival (log-rank, p<0.001).\n",

      "The evidence from both clinical trials and in vitro studies strongly supports the claim that FLT3 ITD mutations in AML are sensitive to gilteritinib. In vitro studies demonstrated that gilteritinib effectively inhibited FLT3 phosphorylation and suppressed growth in cell lines expressing FLT3-ITD, with low IC50 values indicating high sensitivity. Clinical trials, such as the phase 1/2 and phase 3 ADMIRAL trials, showed significant response rates and improved survival outcomes in patients with FLT3-mutated AML treated with gilteritinib compared to those receiving chemotherapy. The higher response rates and greater reduction in bone marrow myeloblasts in FLT3 mutant patients further support the drug's efficacy. Alternative explanations for the observed outcomes could include the presence of other mutations or pathways contributing to AML progression, which might also be affected by gilteritinib, or the possibility of patient-specific factors influencing drug response.\n",

The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 8917: All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",

In the case of a 6-year-old boy with CNS infiltration, larotrectinib, in combination with etoposide and methotrexate, led to molecular remission within 66 days. However, a relapse occurred when larotrectinib was paused, indicating the importance of continuous treatment.

Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",

Eight patient tumours were found to harbour NTRK gene fusions, six of which were ETV6-NTRK3. Treatment with larotrectinib resulted in reduced tumour burden for all patients with NTRK fusions. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 8917: All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",

      "The current data on the L184P (c.551T>C) variant in the VHL gene has several limitations. Firstly, there is a lack of comprehensive family pedigrees, which restricts the ability to fully understand the inheritance patterns and co-segregation of the variant with the disease phenotype. Secondly, there is no detailed phenotypic information for specific patients, which limits the understanding of the variant's impact on the clinical presentation of VHL disease. Additionally, there is an absence of functional analyses to elucidate the biological effects of the L184P mutation, which is crucial for confirming its pathogenicity. These limitations hinder a thorough assessment of the variant's significance, potentially affecting the accuracy of genetic counseling and risk assessment for affected families.\n",

      "- ID 5055: 93 families that fulfilled the clinical criteria of VHL disease were assessed for germline mutations in the VHL gene, and mutations were found in all affected family members. The c.551T>C (p.L184P) mutation was found in a family (Lineage 14) in which members were clinically diagnosed with VHL presenting without pheochromocytoma (VHL type 1), however, no further phenotypic information about specific patients was provided. This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript (AF010238.1). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot. Relevant ACMG codes include: PP4, because the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 5264: Screening of 92 unrelated patients with VHL disease revealed 61 DNA variants. No variants were found in 96 control cases. This missense mutation was found in a VHL type 1 patient and two VHL type 2B patients (patient no. V322, V36, V262). This study contains strong evidence of pathogenicity for this variant because the prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence In controls (ACMG code: PS4). No additional family members were screened in all 3 cases.\n",
      "- ID 5097: Molecular analysis of VHL gene in 146 probands, 103 with and 43 without a positive family history, resulted in the detection of 43 germline VHL mutations. Majority of mutations were found in patients with classic or multi-organ manifestations of VHL disease, but mutations were also found in patients with limited or single-organ manifestations of VHL disease. Follow-up of families with germline mutations and limited VHL manifestations was recommended. This mutation was found in 2 VHL type 2A family members (family no. 23). Both had retinal hemangioblastomas, one had cerebellar hemangioblastomas, and one had pheochromocytoma.  Only supportive evidence for pathogenicity because patient’s phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology (ACMG code: PP4).\n",
      "- ID 4943: In a study of 114 unrelated VHL affected families, germline mutations in the VHL gene were identified in 85 of the families. VHL mutations were detected in affected family members, but not in unaffected family members or 96 normal individuals, however it seems unaffected family members were not tested genetically for the mutations. Mutations in the VHL gene were detected by SSCP and DNA sequencing. Haplotypes were determined with four microsatellite polymorphic probes. The missense mutation L184P (c.551T>C) (In the paper noted as nucleotide position 764 and codon position 255 due to old reference transcript), was found in 2 individuals in family 3708. Both individuals were identified with renal cell carcinoma and one also presented with a CNS hemangioblastoma. Additional information regarding the family information, including a pedigree, were not provided. ACMG evidence codes: 'flag for PP4' since the patients phenotype and family history is consistent with VHL, 'flag for PP1' because there is co-segregation of variant with the phenotype in two members of the family.\n",

Patient 1 presented with retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH) in her left eye at age the age of 13, which was treated with radiation. At age 62 years, this eye had good visual acuity (20/20) without any RCHs. As of her last visit, patient 1 also presented with abnormalities in the CNS, pancreas and kidney. She was found to have the L184P (c.551T>C) mutation. Her last known age was 69 years old. ACMG evidence codes: 'PP4' since the patient presents phenotypes highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 6119: Thirty-five unrelated patients suspected of having von Hippel-Lindau disease had genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes analyzed using sequence analysis of the coding region for VHL / Southern blot analyses. 32 VHL gene variants were found in 35 patients. An association of clear cell renal carcinoma development with a relatively high loss of structural stability in VHL protein missense mutations was discovered, although this only reached significance when combining data from other studies (p=0.101 for present study; p=0.0086 for present study + other study data). This missense variant was found in a patient with spinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, retinal hemangioblastomas, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, and cysts of the broad ligament (patient no. F43).

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The L184P (c.551T>C) variant in the VHL gene is classified as a variant of unknown significance (VUS) for Von Hippel-Lindau Disease due to mixed evidence regarding its pathogenicity. Several studies (IDs 5055, 5264, 5097, 4943, 8491, 6119) have identified this variant in patients with VHL disease, often presenting with phenotypes highly specific to the disease, such as retinal and CNS hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, and pancreatic cysts. However, the lack of consistent co-segregation data, limited family screening, and absence in control populations contribute to the uncertainty of its pathogenic role. While some evidence suggests a potential pathogenic link (e.g., ACMG codes PP4, PS4), the variant's significance remains unclear due to insufficient comprehensive genetic and phenotypic correlation across studies. Therefore, further research and more extensive family studies are needed to clarify the clinical impact of the L184P variant.\"\n",

The SNX2-ABL1 fusion, which joins the N-terminal domain of SNX2 without the PX domain to ABL1 exon 4, was detected by RACE PCR and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The patient responded to initial chemotherapy, but relapsed early. He then demonstrated a response to hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-C-VAD), but relapsed again. The patient next received imatinib and supportive measures, including hydroxycarbamide, but unfortunately succumbed to his disease approximately one year after diagnosis.\n",
      "- ID 7744: This case report describes a 7-year old boy with B-ALL who presented with high white blood count (115.4x109 /L). Karyotype analysis showed a t(5;9)(q22;q34), resulting in a SNX2-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated based on the ALL-BFM95 regimen; although he received remission, he relapsed during maintenance, 15 months after the initial diagnosis. He could not achieve the second remission using chemotherapy, but was treated at this time with imatinib (dose of 240 mg/m2 /d once daily); this allowed to achieve disease control and proceed with an umbilical cord blood transplant. However, at 6 months from transplantation, the patient developed bone marrow relapse again. He never achieved a remission after the second relapse (despite salvage chemotherapies and therapy with both imatinib and dasatinib). The patient died of progressive disease.\n",
      "- ID 7241: A 7-yr-old boy with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia was found to harbor the SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene. Gene expression analysis showed enrichment for BCR-ABL1+ ALL using GSEA. After first relapse (15 months after diagnosis) the patient was given imatinib at a dose of 240 mg/m2/d once daily and his disease stabilized for 2 months. The patient received dasatinib (80 mg/m2/d once daily) after an umbilical cord blood transplant and did not respond to treatment. Patient was put back on imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/m2/d once daily which rapidly decreased the number of blast cells. However, 6 months after transplant he had bone marrow relapse and did not again achieve remission by the time of reporting.\n",
      "- ID 9178: In the study involving 1725 B-ALL patients, 264 were identified by microarray-based algorithm to have a Ph-like expression signature. Next generation sequencing (RNAseq, WGS, and/or WES) performed on 154 Ph-like patients revealed 91% possessed genomic alterations activating kinase signaling with 96 (62%) involving rearrangements. In one adolescent male, an in-frame SNX2-ABL1 fusion (exon 3 and exon 4) with the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain intact was identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger. This patient, evaluated by WES and RNA-seq, also harbored IKZF1, EBF1, and VPREB deletions, and was designated Ph-like non CRLF2.\n",

      "Additional Information:\n",
      "- Molecular Profile: ABL1 SNX2::ABL1\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

      "The presence of SNX2-ABL1 fusions in patients with Ph-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia generally indicates a poor prognosis and challenges in treatment response. Patients with this fusion often do not respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like imatinib or dasatinib, as seen in the cases described. Despite initial responses to chemotherapy, these patients frequently experience early relapses and have limited success with subsequent treatments, including TKIs and bone marrow transplants. Compared to other genetic alterations like BCR-ABL1, SNX2-ABL1 fusions seem to result in a more aggressive disease course with fewer effective treatment options.

      "The poor clinical outcomes in patients with SNX2-ABL1 fusions may be influenced by additional genetic factors such as deletions of IKZF1 and EBF1, as well as amplifications of PAX5. These genetic alterations can disrupt normal B-cell development and function, potentially leading to more aggressive disease phenotypes. The presence of the SNX2-ABL1 fusion, which retains the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain, may drive oncogenic signaling pathways, further exacerbating disease progression. The lack of treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, which could target the ABL1 kinase activity, might also contribute to poor outcomes. Together, these factors can create a more resistant and aggressive form of leukemia, complicating treatment and leading to worse prognoses.\n",

      "- ID 9177: This retrospective study intended to clarify clinical characteristics of patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL) and kinase fusions that are not well described (excluding ETV6-RUNX1, E2A-PBX1, MLL rearrangements and BCR-ABL). The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is rare; in this study investigating 373 high risk pediatric B-ALL patients of which 29 demonstrated uncommon kinase gene fusions, only one case with SNX2-ABL1 (exon 3-exon 4) was observed. Gene expression profiles were compared to Ph-positive B-ALL and reportedly all fusion-containing samples (except P2RY8-CRLF2) were similar to BCR-ABL1-positive patients. This patient did not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered in combination with chemotherapy at the first or second relapses.\n",
      "- ID 7694: A 16 yr-old male with precursor B-ALL was found to have the t(5;9)(q23;q34) in his peripheral blasts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RT-PCR, and sequencing of the product confirmed a SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene (SNX2 exon 3 fused in frame to ABL1 exon 4) was present. The patient also was found to carry an IKZF1 deletion (exons 2-8) and amplification of PAX5. The patient was treated with vindesine, idarubicin, and dexamethasone (VDP) and VDCP (plus cyclophosphamide) regimens. He received two bone marrow transplants, but eventually died of disease. The patient did not receive tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.\n",
      "- ID 7254: In a 29-year-old man with pre B-cell ALL, the t(5;9)(q23;q34) [SNX2-ABL1] was identified. The SNX2-ABL1 fusion, which joins the N-terminal domain of SNX2 without the PX domain to ABL1 exon 4, was detected by RACE PCR and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The patient responded to initial chemotherapy, but relapsed early. He then demonstrated a response to hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-C-VAD), but relapsed again. The patient next received imatinib and supportive measures, including hydroxycarbamide, but unfortunately succumbed to his disease approximately one year after diagnosis.\n",
      "- ID 7744: This case report describes a 7-year old boy with B-ALL who presented with high white blood count (115.4x109 /L). Karyotype analysis showed a t(5;9)(q22;q34), resulting in a SNX2-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated based on the ALL-BFM95 regimen; although he received remission, he relapsed during maintenance, 15 months after the initial diagnosis. He could not achieve the second remission using chemotherapy, but was treated at this time with imatinib (dose of 240 mg/m2 /d once daily); this allowed to achieve disease control and proceed with an umbilical cord blood transplant. However, at 6 months from transplantation, the patient developed bone marrow relapse again. He never achieved a remission after the second relapse (despite salvage chemotherapies and therapy with both imatinib and dasatinib). The patient died of progressive disease.\n",
      "- ID 7241: A 7-yr-old boy with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia was found to harbor the SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene. Gene expression analysis showed enrichment for BCR-ABL1+ ALL using GSEA. After first relapse (15 months after diagnosis) the patient was given imatinib at a dose of 240 mg/m2/d once daily and his disease stabilized for 2 months. The patient received dasatinib (80 mg/m2/d once daily) after an umbilical cord blood transplant and did not respond to treatment. Patient was put back on imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/m2/d once daily which rapidly decreased the number of blast cells. However, 6 months after transplant he had bone marrow relapse and did not again achieve remission by the time of reporting.\n",
      "- ID 9178: In the study involving 1725 B-ALL patients, 264 were identified by microarray-based algorithm to have a Ph-like expression signature. Next generation sequencing (RNAseq, WGS, and/or WES) performed on 154 Ph-like patients revealed 91% possessed genomic alterations activating kinase signaling with 96 (62%) involving rearrangements. In one adolescent male, an in-frame SNX2-ABL1 fusion (exon 3 and exon 4) with the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain intact was identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger. This patient, evaluated by WES and RNA-seq, also harbored IKZF1, EBF1, and VPREB deletions, and was designated Ph-like non CRLF2.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ABL1 SNX2::ABL1\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is associated with Ph-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia, as evidenced by its presence in several cases of B-ALL with a Ph-like expression signature. Despite its rarity, the fusion has been identified in multiple patients, often alongside other genetic alterations such as IKZF1 deletions, which are common in Ph-like ALL. The fusion protein retains the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain, suggesting potential responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however, clinical outcomes have been poor, with patients often relapsing despite treatment with these inhibitors. This indicates that while the SNX2-ABL1 fusion may contribute to the disease phenotype, it alone does not fully account for the clinical outcomes, highlighting the complexity of Ph-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia and the need for further research into additional contributing factors and therapeutic strategies.\"\n",

      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",
      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",

One possibility is the natural variability in tumor progression, where some tumors may regress or stabilize without targeted therapy. Another explanation could be the placebo effect, where the patient's belief in the treatment contributes to perceived improvements. Additionally, the initial surgical resection and radiation therapy might have had delayed effects that coincidentally aligned with the timing of larotrectinib administration.

      "The evidence suggests that the increased phosphorylated-Akt/total Akt ratio in the 97-7 bladder cancer cell line, which expresses the FGFR3 S249C mutation, is associated with resistance to cisplatin. This aligns with existing scientific understanding that Akt signaling is a key pathway in promoting cell survival and drug resistance in cancer. The reversal of this resistance through siRNA knockdown of FGFR3 and the increased sensitivity to cisplatin upon inhibition of Akt signaling further supports the role of Akt in mediating the oncogenic effects of FGFR3 S249C. However, while this evidence strongly implicates Akt signaling in the oncogenic behavior of FGFR3 S249C, it does not entirely exclude other potential pathways or mechanisms that might also contribute to the cancer phenotype. Therefore, while the evidence fits well with known oncogenic pathways, it should be considered as part of a broader investigation into the multifaceted roles of FGFR3 mutations in cancer.\n",

Among TRK fusion-positive patients overall, 93% achieved an objective response, indicating a generally high efficacy of larotrectinib across different TRK fusion-positive cancers. The high response rate in ETV6::NTRK3-positive infantile fibrosarcoma is consistent with the overall response rate in TRK fusion-positive cancers, suggesting that the presence of TRK fusions is a significant factor in the effectiveness of larotrectinib. Differences in response rates among various TRK fusion-positive cancers could be influenced by the specific type of TRK fusion, tumor biology, and individual patient factors.

      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",
      "- ID 10362: In a further investigation of non-traditional sarcoma cases, a 41-year-old man was thought to have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in the neck and spinal cord, but large rhabdoid/epithelioid cell morphology and retained H3K27Me3. Metastatic lesions were found in the lung and spine. Pan-TRK immunostain was positive and RNA NGS detected a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion. The authors state this is the first report of a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion in a sarcoma, which seems to forecast high-grade morphology and behavior.\n",
      "- ID 8653: A case report showing a two-year-old girl with an unusual pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) with both classic- and anaplastic- appearing tumors. A custom NGS panel identified a novel KANK1-NTRK2 fusion in both the classic and anaplastic regions. The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.\n",
      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",

      "The current evidence presents cases of KANK1::NTRK2 fusions in different tumor types, but there are gaps that could undermine its classification as an oncogenic NTRK fusion. Firstly, there is no comprehensive molecular profile summary that includes other potential genetic alterations or mutations that might contribute to tumorigenesis. Additionally, there is a lack of information on therapeutic responses or outcomes in patients with this specific fusion, which is crucial for understanding its clinical significance. The absence of a broader dataset or studies that confirm the oncogenic role of KANK1::NTRK2 across multiple cases or tumor types also limits the ability to generalize its classification. Additional data, such as larger cohort studies, detailed molecular profiling, and clinical trial results, could help address these gaps and provide a more robust understanding of the fusion's role in cancer.\n",

      "- ID 10896: From a retrospective review of 38,095 tumor samples from 33,997 patients that underwent fusion screening at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 87 tumors were found to be positive for an NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusion. One positive patient with Glioblastoma Multiforme had an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 (e11::e14) fusion that was not detected by MSK-IMPACT, but was found with the RNA Archer screen. Detection of this fusion was positive in the cytoplasm by Pan-Trk immunohistochemical staining.\n",
      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",
      "- ID 10362: In a further investigation of non-traditional sarcoma cases, a 41-year-old man was thought to have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in the neck and spinal cord, but large rhabdoid/epithelioid cell morphology and retained H3K27Me3. Metastatic lesions were found in the lung and spine. Pan-TRK immunostain was positive and RNA NGS detected a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion. The authors state this is the first report of a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion in a sarcoma, which seems to forecast high-grade morphology and behavior.\n",
      "- ID 8653: A case report showing a two-year-old girl with an unusual pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) with both classic- and anaplastic- appearing tumors. A custom NGS panel identified a novel KANK1-NTRK2 fusion in both the classic and anaplastic regions. The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.\n",
      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",

The patient had a history of hemimelia in the same limb as the congenital fibrosarcoma, but no known family history and no known prenatal exposures. Because the typical ETV6::NTRK3 fusion was not found, more extensive molecular profiling was done. A t(2;15)(p21;q24) translocation was identified by cytogenetics and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed clear copy-number transitions within EML4 and NTRK3. An EML4::NTRK3 (e2::e14) fusion was confirmed by RNA sequencing. This fusion was in-frame with breakpoints at exon 2 of EML4 and exon 14 of NTRK3. Stable lentiviral transduction of this fusion into NIH-3T3 cells induced soft agar colony growth in vitro and tumors in vivo. Based on similar positive cellular transformation and functional motifs to the typically found ETV6::NTRK3, the authors conclude other fusion partners like EML4::NTRK3 can contribute to the development of congenital fibrosarcoma.\n",
      "- ID 11276: In this study, a collection of pediatric spindle cell tumors were screened for the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion by RT-PCR.  10 of 11 (91%) cases diagnosed as congenital fibrosarcoma were found to harbor the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion while none of the 51 other malignant or benign spindle cell tumors (including adult-type fibrosarcoma, infantile fibromatosis, myofibromatosis, and more aggressive malignant spindle cell tumors) were positive for this fusion.  The authors conclude ETV6::NTRK3 RT-PCR analysis is a reliable and specific modality to aid in the diagnosis of this disease.\n",

      "- ID 11517: This case study detailed a 9-month-old male with congenital fibrosarcoma with subsequent metastasis to the lungs. The patient had a history of hemimelia in the same limb as the congenital fibrosarcoma, but no known family history and no known prenatal exposures. Because the typical ETV6::NTRK3 fusion was not found, more extensive molecular profiling was done. A t(2;15)(p21;q24) translocation was identified by cytogenetics and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed clear copy-number transitions within EML4 and NTRK3. An EML4::NTRK3 (e2::e14) fusion was confirmed by RNA sequencing. This fusion was in-frame with breakpoints at exon 2 of EML4 and exon 14 of NTRK3. Stable lentiviral transduction of this fusion into NIH-3T3 cells induced soft agar colony growth in vitro and tumors in vivo. Based on similar positive cellular transformation and functional motifs to the typically found ETV6::NTRK3, the authors conclude other fusion partners like EML4::NTRK3 can contribute to the development of congenital fibrosarcoma.\n",
      "- ID 8931: The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 8930: Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis of a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk) revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).\n",

In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response.

The evidence from ID 8931 and ID 8930 demonstrates the oncogenic potential of the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), with the fusion leading to aggressive leukemia in a mouse model and successful treatment with Larotrectinib in a human case. Additionally, ID 6099 provides evidence of the fusion's oncogenic role in infantile fibrosarcoma, where patients with ETV6::NTRK3 fusion-positive tumors showed significant responses to targeted therapy. The evidence collectively supports the claim by showing the fusion's involvement in different cancer types and its responsiveness to targeted treatments, indicating its oncogenic nature across multiple contexts. However, the evidence also highlights the need for further research to fully understand the fusion's role in other cancer types and its potential as a therapeutic target.\"\n",

      "- ID 1122: HERA was a Phase III trial assessing application of trastuzumab in an extended adjuvant setting.  Patients were HER2 positive with completely excised invasive BC, node positive or negative, and having undergone prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.  In the 3 arm study patients were given trastuzumab courses of 1 year, 2 years, or untreated.  At the first planned interim analysis, trastuzumab treatment for one year was compared with observation alone.  A significant difference in disease-free survival was seen with 220 DFS events out of 1693 in the observation arm versus 127 DFS events out of 1694 in the 1 year trastuzumab arm.  1 year adjuvant trastuzumab is currently the standard of care.\n",
      "- ID 529: A randomized clinical trial of 186 patients with previously untreated, HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer demonstrated improved overall survival, response rate, response duration, time to progression, and time to treatment failure for patients who received trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy (docetaxel) compared to chemotherapy alone.\n",
      "- ID 528: A randomized clinical trial of 469 patients with previously untreated, HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer demonstrated improved time to disease progression, objective response rate, and duration of response for patients who received trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone.\n",
      "- ID 11774: Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2), resulting in partial duplication of the transcription factor MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint between exons 10 and 11 of MYB on 6q23.3 was identified in two of four angiocentric gliomas (AGs). This study did not mention the partner genes involved in the MYB rearrangements in the two AGs. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ERBB2 Amplification\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\n",

While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 1190: Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.\n",

The IC50 for parental Ba/F3 supplemented with IL3 was 2299 nM, resulting in a fold difference of 209.2 for EML4-ALK and 55.1 for NPM-ALK, indicating some reduced sensitivity for NPM-ALK in direct comparison to EML4-ALK, but substantial sensitization to crizotinib for NPM-ALK in Ba/F3 cells.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.  These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.\n",

By PCR, the authors show strong increase in fold change of mRNA expression in downstream proteins of the ACVR1/BMP pathway, ID, ID2, ID3 and SNAI1 in ACVR1-mutant DIPG cell line compared to glioblastoma cells (KNS42 cells). These activating ACVR1 mutations were exclusively in midline high grade astrocytomas (P = 0.0040, Fisher's exact test).\n",

Evidence ID 4846 highlights that ACVR1 mutations, specifically the G328V variant, are associated with increased signaling in the BMP pathway, which is a characteristic feature of DIPG cells. This finding is corroborated by Evidence ID 6955, which reports recurrent ACVR1 mutations in DIPG patients, further supporting the role of these mutations in the disease's pathology. The coherence of these findings with established knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of DIPG strengthens the claim, as the presence of ACVR1 mutations aligns with the known genetic landscape of high-grade gliomas, thereby providing a robust basis for their use in diagnosis.\"\n",

A striking clinical characteristic of YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma was that large proportion of patients survive many years with stable disease despite having multifocal disease and distant metastasis.

Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.\n",

Several studies have identified this variant in individuals with clinical manifestations consistent with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, such as central nervous system and retinal hemangioblastomas, and renal cell carcinoma. The variant has been observed to co-segregate with the disease in multiple families, supporting its pathogenicity (evidence IDs 5805, 6860). Additionally, the variant is located in a mutational hotspot of the VHL gene, which is known for a low rate of benign missense variation, further suggesting its pathogenic nature (evidence ID 6860). The rarity of the variant in population databases (ExAC, gnomAD) and its absence in control groups (evidence ID 5273) also support its pathogenic classification. However, some family members carrying the variant are asymptomatic, indicating potential variable expressivity or incomplete penetrance, which should be considered in the clinical interpretation.\"\n",

The above mutation was found in 1 kindred; 10 members were tested and 3 were found to harbour the mutation. The 7 members without a mutation were asymptomatic, while the 3 members with a mutation had manifestations. In addition to the 3 members who tested positive, there were 2 additional members who displayed manifestations, but died before testing could be performed. Clinical manifestations in this kindred included: renal cell carcinoma, CNS hemangioblastoma, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, and retinal hemangioblastoma.

A total of eight patients had NTRK fusions, and by independent radiology review, all patients with TRK fusion were considered to have had an objective response. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion.

(2016) included a total of 60 cases with known TFE3 gene rearrangements in this study of Xp11 translocation positive neoplasms (47 RCC, 8 PEComa, and 5 melanotic renal cancers). The age range for the RCC cases was 5 to 73 years. Fusion partners of TFE3 were identified using FISH (with confirmation by RNA sequencing in 5 cases) for 41/47 RCC cases, and included 7 SFPQ::TFE3 (PSF), 16 PRCC::TFE3, 12 ASPSCR1::TFE3 (ASPL), 5 NONO::TFE3, and 1 DVL2::TFE3. For the remaining 6 cases, the fusion partner of TFE3 was unable to be determined. The authors conclude that despite an identical gene fusion, the RCCs are distinct from the corresponding mesenchymal neoplasms and that the data can expand further the clinicopathologic features of cancers with specific TFE3 gene fusions.\n",

This publication reported results from an AACR meeting for an ongoing study that had enrolled six patients with NTRK fusions, three of whom could be evaluated at the time. Each had a different, heavily pretreated advanced disease: soft-tissue sarcoma; gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST); and MASC. All three patients experienced partial responses by 3-4 months with resolution of key tumour-related symptoms within two weeks.

      "- ID 11781: Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2). All five DA2 samples with 8q focal gains exhibited a common centromeric breakpoint within MYBL1 after exon 9, resulting in partial duplication of MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged DA2 demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication with the telomeric sequence located in MMP16. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional DA2s with MYBL1 partial duplication. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas (AGs) in the related gene MYB on 6q23.3. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy.\n",

IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib. Additionally, plasma taken from 3 patients receiving 120mg of gilteritinib daily was able to inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation in Molm14 cells.\n",

Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001).

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.\n",

Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).\n",

RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 8917: All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus.

Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",

TFE3 immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing confirmed 22 of these (34%) were Xp11.2 RCC.  TFE3 rearrangements define RCCs with Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion, which, in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, further belongs to the category of \"MiT family translocation renal cell carcinoma.\" The MiT family (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor family) translocation RCC comprises of the Xp11 translocation RCC harboring TFE3 gene fusions and the t(6;11) renal cell carcinoma harboring TFEB gene fusion. This study showed that the Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion RCC can be difficult to diagnose by pathology, and that evaluation by FISH is a useful diagnostic tool for this tumor type.\n",
      "- ID 12057: In this 2014 study, the authors compared 10 primary sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas (SEF), 4 cases of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), and one primary hybrid SEF/LGFMS. Patients with SEF ranged from 28 to 91 years of age. Using RT-PCR, they detected in-frame fusions in 3/4 cases with suitable samples, joining either exon 7, 8, or 11 of EWSR1 to exon 6 of CREB3L1. Split signals at EWSR1 and CREB3L1 were detected by FISH in an additional case. All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement. The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.\n",

An association of clear cell renal carcinoma development with a relatively high loss of structural stability in VHL protein missense mutations was discovered, although this only reached significance when combining data from other studies (p=0.101 for present study; p=0.0086 for present study + other study data). This missense variant was found in a patient with spinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, retinal hemangioblastomas, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, and cysts of the broad ligament (patient no. F43). The patient was 27 years old. ACMG PP4 as patient's phenotypes are highly specific for VHL disease.\n",
      "- ID 5055: 93 families that fulfilled the clinical criteria of VHL disease were assessed for germline mutations in the VHL gene, and mutations were found in all affected family members. The c.551T>C (p.L184P) mutation was found in a family (Lineage 14) in which members were clinically diagnosed with VHL presenting without pheochromocytoma (VHL type 1), however, no further phenotypic information about specific patients was provided. This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript (AF010238.1). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot. Relevant ACMG codes include: PP4, because the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 4291: In an in vitro study, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EGFR L858R was associated with sensitivity to erlotinib treatment (IC50 26.9 ± 12.4). Sensitivity was determined by assessing cell viability, AKT and ERK phosphorylation, and EGFR auto-phosphorylation.\n",
      "- ID 11530: In this 2012 paper, the authors assessed potential characteristic markers in 24 alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS cases), age range from 13 to 61 years, and 23 non-ASPS tumors. Nuclear immunoreactivity for the TFE3 protein was observed in 22 of 24 ASPS specimens. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion transcript was detected by RT-PCR in all 24 cases and was not detected in any of the 23 non-ASPS tumors. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 involves either exon 3 or 4 of TFE3 fused to ASPSCR1, which replaces the N-terminus of TFE3 but retains the DNA-binding region, activation domain, and nuclear localization signal. The fusion transcripts were composed of 7 type 1 (ASPCR1 fusion to TFE3 exon 4) and 17 type 2 (ASPCR1 fusion to TFE3 exon 3) transcripts.  The authors conclude that ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion detection is an effective diagnostic technique for ASPS.\n",

Evidence from multiple studies (IDs 4943, 8491, 6119, and 5055) shows that this variant is present in individuals with phenotypes consistent with VHL disease, such as renal cell carcinoma and CNS hemangioblastomas, and is flagged with ACMG evidence codes like PP4 and PP1, indicating phenotypic specificity and co-segregation with the disease. However, the lack of comprehensive family data and genetic testing of unaffected family members, as well as the absence of this variant in unaffected individuals, leaves uncertainty about its pathogenic role.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RT-PCR, and sequencing of the product confirmed a SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene (SNX2 exon 3 fused in frame to ABL1 exon 4) was present. The patient also was found to carry an IKZF1 deletion (exons 2-8) and amplification of PAX5. The patient was treated with vindesine, idarubicin, and dexamethasone (VDP) and VDCP (plus cyclophosphamide) regimens. He received two bone marrow transplants, but eventually died of disease. The patient did not receive tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.\n",

The SNX2-ABL1 fusion, which joins the N-terminal domain of SNX2 without the PX domain to ABL1 exon 4, was detected by RACE PCR and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The patient responded to initial chemotherapy, but relapsed early. He then demonstrated a response to hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-C-VAD), but relapsed again. The patient next received imatinib and supportive measures, including hydroxycarbamide, but unfortunately succumbed to his disease approximately one year after diagnosis.\n",

The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is rare; in this study investigating 373 high risk pediatric B-ALL patients of which 29 demonstrated uncommon kinase gene fusions, only one case with SNX2-ABL1 (exon 3-exon 4) was observed. Gene expression profiles were compared to Ph-positive B-ALL and reportedly all fusion-containing samples (except P2RY8-CRLF2) were similar to BCR-ABL1-positive patients. This patient did not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered in combination with chemotherapy at the first or second relapses.\n",
      "- ID 7744: This case report describes a 7-year old boy with B-ALL who presented with high white blood count (115.4x109 /L). Karyotype analysis showed a t(5;9)(q22;q34), resulting in a SNX2-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated based on the ALL-BFM95 regimen; although he received remission, he relapsed during maintenance, 15 months after the initial diagnosis. He could not achieve the second remission using chemotherapy, but was treated at this time with imatinib (dose of 240 mg/m2 /d once daily); this allowed to achieve disease control and proceed with an umbilical cord blood transplant. However, at 6 months from transplantation, the patient developed bone marrow relapse again. He never achieved a remission after the second relapse (despite salvage chemotherapies and therapy with both imatinib and dasatinib). The patient died of progressive disease.\n",
      "- ID 7241: A 7-yr-old boy with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia was found to harbor the SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene. Gene expression analysis showed enrichment for BCR-ABL1+ ALL using GSEA. After first relapse (15 months after diagnosis) the patient was given imatinib at a dose of 240 mg/m2/d once daily and his disease stabilized for 2 months. The patient received dasatinib (80 mg/m2/d once daily) after an umbilical cord blood transplant and did not respond to treatment. Patient was put back on imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/m2/d once daily which rapidly decreased the number of blast cells. However, 6 months after transplant he had bone marrow relapse and did not again achieve remission by the time of reporting.\n",

Next generation sequencing (RNAseq, WGS, and/or WES) performed on 154 Ph-like patients revealed 91% possessed genomic alterations activating kinase signaling with 96 (62%) involving rearrangements. In one adolescent male, an in-frame SNX2-ABL1 fusion (exon 3 and exon 4) with the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain intact was identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger. This patient, evaluated by WES and RNA-seq, also harbored IKZF1, EBF1, and VPREB deletions, and was designated Ph-like non CRLF2.\n",

(2022) performed a comprehensive study of the molecular and clinical features of translocation renal cell carcinomas (tRCCs), defined as subtype of kidney cancer driven by MiT/TFE gene fusions. Across the combined tRCC cohort, the majority of cases (78 cases; 88.6%) harbored TFE3 fusions, while the remainder harbored TFEB (8 cases; 9.1%) or MITF (2 cases; 2.3%) fusions.  Four different TFEB fusion partners were observed including CADM2, CLTC, COL21A1 and MALAT1. TFEB and MITF fusion partners tended to preserve less of the N-terminal fusion partner in the fusion product compared to TFE3. The authors conclude that most tRCCs harbor few somatic alterations apart from MiT/TFE fusions.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ABL1 SNX2::ABL1\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

Studies have shown that SNX2-ABL1 fusions result in constitutive kinase activity, similar to other ABL1 fusion proteins, which can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation characteristic of leukemia. This fusion is one of several genetic alterations identified in Ph-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia, a subtype known for its poor prognosis and resistance to standard therapies. However, the presence of other genetic abnormalities in this leukemia subtype suggests that SNX2-ABL1 fusions are part of a broader spectrum of molecular changes, and not the sole driver of the disease. Therefore, while the evidence supports the association, it also highlights the complexity of the disease and the need for comprehensive genetic profiling to fully understand its pathogenesis.\"\n",

      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",
      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",

IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing data demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Three tumors had MYB fusions with the gene partners, including HMG20A (n=1) and PCDHGA1 (n=2). These gene fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain and/or a loss of the negative regulatory 3' miRNA-binding sites with an associated increase in MYB expression. Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYB in 3 tumors, including one tumor with gains involving both MYB and HMG20A resulting in two different MYB::HMG20A fusions and two tumors without MYB fusions detected. Increased MYB expression was observed in four (4/6) tumors\n",

Using a thymidine incorporation assay, S249C expressing cells were shown to lose contact inhibition and grew 3x to 4x more rapidly than controls. Soft agar assays demonstrated increased colony formation and anchorage independent growth in S249C expressing cells versus controls.

      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",
      "- ID 10362: In a further investigation of non-traditional sarcoma cases, a 41-year-old man was thought to have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in the neck and spinal cord, but large rhabdoid/epithelioid cell morphology and retained H3K27Me3. Metastatic lesions were found in the lung and spine. Pan-TRK immunostain was positive and RNA NGS detected a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion. The authors state this is the first report of a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion in a sarcoma, which seems to forecast high-grade morphology and behavior.\n",
      "- ID 10896: From a retrospective review of 38,095 tumor samples from 33,997 patients that underwent fusion screening at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 87 tumors were found to be positive for an NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusion. One positive patient with Glioblastoma Multiforme had an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 (e11::e14) fusion that was not detected by MSK-IMPACT, but was found with the RNA Archer screen. Detection of this fusion was positive in the cytoplasm by Pan-Trk immunohistochemical staining.\n",
      "- ID 8653: A case report showing a two-year-old girl with an unusual pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) with both classic- and anaplastic- appearing tumors. A custom NGS panel identified a novel KANK1-NTRK2 fusion in both the classic and anaplastic regions. The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.\n",
      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",
      "- ID 7291: Integrated genomic analysis was performed for 1,988 childhood and adult B-ALL cases. Forty four cases (2.2%) showed the P80R substitution in the DNA binding domain for the PAX5 transcription factor gene. These cases were characterized by a unique expression profile. In the majority of the cases the mutation was hemizygous or homozygous, owing to deletion of the wild-type PAX5 allele or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. In 96% (42 of 44) of cases, the PAK5 P80R was accompanied by RAS and/or JAK-STAT signaling-pathway alterations (such as NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, NF1, IL7R), thereby suggesting cooperativity between deregulated PAX5 activity and kinase signaling.  The PAX5 P80R is proposed to define a distinct subtype of B-ALL.\n",

The patient had a history of hemimelia in the same limb as the congenital fibrosarcoma, but no known family history and no known prenatal exposures. Because the typical ETV6::NTRK3 fusion was not found, more extensive molecular profiling was done. A t(2;15)(p21;q24) translocation was identified by cytogenetics and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed clear copy-number transitions within EML4 and NTRK3. An EML4::NTRK3 (e2::e14) fusion was confirmed by RNA sequencing. This fusion was in-frame with breakpoints at exon 2 of EML4 and exon 14 of NTRK3. Stable lentiviral transduction of this fusion into NIH-3T3 cells induced soft agar colony growth in vitro and tumors in vivo. Based on similar positive cellular transformation and functional motifs to the typically found ETV6::NTRK3, the authors conclude other fusion partners like EML4::NTRK3 can contribute to the development of congenital fibrosarcoma.\n",

FUS exon 6 and CREB3L2 exon 5 were most frequently rearranged. Median age at LGFMS diagnosis was 35 years (range 11 to 75 years). 7 of 52 non-LGMFS neoplasms contained a FUS-CREB3L2 fusion with 4 of these diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, a sarcoma known to have molecular and morphological overlap with LGMFS.

      "Evidence List:\n",
      "- ID 1122: HERA was a Phase III trial assessing application of trastuzumab in an extended adjuvant setting.  Patients were HER2 positive with completely excised invasive BC, node positive or negative, and having undergone prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.  In the 3 arm study patients were given trastuzumab courses of 1 year, 2 years, or untreated.  At the first planned interim analysis, trastuzumab treatment for one year was compared with observation alone.  A significant difference in disease-free survival was seen with 220 DFS events out of 1693 in the observation arm versus 127 DFS events out of 1694 in the 1 year trastuzumab arm.  1 year adjuvant trastuzumab is currently the standard of care.\n",
      "- ID 529: A randomized clinical trial of 186 patients with previously untreated, HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer demonstrated improved overall survival, response rate, response duration, time to progression, and time to treatment failure for patients who received trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy (docetaxel) compared to chemotherapy alone.\n",
      "- ID 1643: A DNAJB1:PRKACA fusion transcript was detected at very high expression levels by RNA-Seq in a case of mixed fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. Subsequent analysis revealed the presence of this fusion in all primary and metastatic samples, including those with mixed or conventional HCC pathology. A second case of mFL-HCC confirmed that the fusion was detectable in conventional components. An expanded screen of 112 additional HCC samples and 44 adjacent non-tumor liver samples was positive for a third case of HCC with both conventional and fibrolamellar features but negative for all conventional HCC and adjacent non-tumor liver samples.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ERBB2 Amplification\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\n",

Evidence ID 1122 from the HERA Phase III trial demonstrates that patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who received one year of adjuvant Trastuzumab had significantly improved disease-free survival compared to those who did not receive the treatment. Similarly, evidence ID 529 shows that in a randomized clinical trial, patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who received Trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy had improved overall survival and response rates compared to chemotherapy alone. These findings align with the molecular profile summary, which indicates that HER2 amplifications are associated with aggressive breast cancer, and Trastuzumab has been effective in treating HER2-positive cases.

While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 1190: Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.\n",

      "- ID 11428: In an analysis of 13 cases of supratentorial glial tumors with ZFTA rearrangements without RELA involvement, all were found to have DNA methylation profiles similar to ZFTA::RELA supratentorial ependymoma.  The underlying ZFTA rearrangements included 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 fusions, 4 ZFTA::NCOA2 fusions, 3 ZFTA::MALM2 fusions, 1 novel MN1::ZFTA fusion, and a truncated ZFTA product.  Of the 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 in-frame fusions identified, 2 contained 4 zinc finger C2H2 domains of ZFTA at the N-terminus fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1 at the C terminus.  The third only contained 1 zinc finger C2H2 domain of ZFTA fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1.  Of note, the 1 case with only 1 zinc finger domain had a sarcoma-like histology rather than the more classic EPN-like histology.\n",
      "- ID 11539: A subset of renal neoplasms of children and young adults contains t(6;11)(p21;q12), fusion of the MALAT1 (Alpha) gene with the transcription factor gene TFEB. Argani, et al. (2005) included 7 renal neoplasms with cytogenetic and/or molecular evidence of the t(6;11)(p21;q12). The patients ranged from 9 to 33 years in age. All of the 7 renal neoplasms demonstrated either moderate or strong nuclear immunoreactivity for TFEB protein, and 1089 other neoplasms were tested but none showed significant labeling for TFEB. In 3 cases frozen tissue was available for RNA extraction, and RT-PCR detected the MALAT1(Alpha0::TFEB fusion. The potentially wide size range of MALAT1(Alpha)::TFEB fusion transcripts complicates the detection of this fusion by RT-PCR for robust detection in clinical RNA samples. The lack of splice signals in Alpha resulted in DNA PCR products of the same size as the RT-PCR products when the reverse primer binds to TFEB exon 3. The authors conclude that immunoreactivity for TFEB protein is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for these renal neoplasms and suggest that long-range DNA PCR may a useful alternative to RT-PCR due to the special molecular features of the Alpha::TFEB gene fusion.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

      "The sensitivity of different EML4-ALK fusion variants to crizotinib treatment is influenced by the structural differences among the variants. Specifically, variant v3a (E6;A20) is the least sensitive to crizotinib, while variant v2 (E20;A20) is the most sensitive. This differential sensitivity is partly due to the stability of the fusion proteins; v2 has a shorter half-life compared to v3a, which may lead to increased sensitivity to crizotinib. The structural differences in the ALK fusions, such as length and specific insertions, can affect the stability and degradation rate of the fusion proteins, impacting their response to inhibitors. These mechanisms suggest that the type and structure of ALK fusions can significantly influence the effectiveness of crizotinib in treating lung adenocarcinoma, with some variants responding better to treatment than others.\n",

      "- ID 1187: In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.\n",
      "- ID 1189: In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.\n",
      "- ID 1196: EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) were expressed in Ba/F3 cells using retrovirus.  While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 1190: Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.\n",
      "- ID 1197: Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) showed differential sensitivity to both crizotinib and TAE684, with variant 3a (E6;A20) being the least sensitive. The authors suggest that the type/structure of ALK fusion may have some impact on patient outcome in targeted therapy.\n",
      "- ID 11428: In an analysis of 13 cases of supratentorial glial tumors with ZFTA rearrangements without RELA involvement, all were found to have DNA methylation profiles similar to ZFTA::RELA supratentorial ependymoma.  The underlying ZFTA rearrangements included 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 fusions, 4 ZFTA::NCOA2 fusions, 3 ZFTA::MALM2 fusions, 1 novel MN1::ZFTA fusion, and a truncated ZFTA product.  Of the 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 in-frame fusions identified, 2 contained 4 zinc finger C2H2 domains of ZFTA at the N-terminus fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1 at the C terminus.  The third only contained 1 zinc finger C2H2 domain of ZFTA fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1.  Of note, the 1 case with only 1 zinc finger domain had a sarcoma-like histology rather than the more classic EPN-like histology.\n",
      "- ID 11539: A subset of renal neoplasms of children and young adults contains t(6;11)(p21;q12), fusion of the MALAT1 (Alpha) gene with the transcription factor gene TFEB. Argani, et al. (2005) included 7 renal neoplasms with cytogenetic and/or molecular evidence of the t(6;11)(p21;q12). The patients ranged from 9 to 33 years in age. All of the 7 renal neoplasms demonstrated either moderate or strong nuclear immunoreactivity for TFEB protein, and 1089 other neoplasms were tested but none showed significant labeling for TFEB. In 3 cases frozen tissue was available for RNA extraction, and RT-PCR detected the MALAT1(Alpha0::TFEB fusion. The potentially wide size range of MALAT1(Alpha)::TFEB fusion transcripts complicates the detection of this fusion by RT-PCR for robust detection in clinical RNA samples. The lack of splice signals in Alpha resulted in DNA PCR products of the same size as the RT-PCR products when the reverse primer binds to TFEB exon 3. The authors conclude that immunoreactivity for TFEB protein is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for these renal neoplasms and suggest that long-range DNA PCR may a useful alternative to RT-PCR due to the special molecular features of the Alpha::TFEB gene fusion.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

However, evidence from trials like J-ALEX and others indicate that alectinib may offer superior outcomes in terms of progression-free survival and CNS progression rates. While crizotinib is effective, the evidence suggests that alectinib might be a more potent alternative, highlighting the need for personalized treatment strategies based on specific patient profiles and disease characteristics.

      "The presence of the R167Q variant in different VHL subtypes, such as type 2B and type 2, suggests that it may have a role in the development of pheochromocytoma, as indicated by its association with this condition in multiple studies. The variant's presence in both VHL type 2B and type 2 families, where it is linked to pheochromocytoma, supports its pathogenicity, particularly given the high risk (62%) for pheochromocytoma associated with the Arg167Gln mutation. However, the variant's role in other VHL-related manifestations, such as retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas, also needs consideration. Additional phenotypic data, such as the specific clinical presentations in individuals with the R167Q variant, and genetic data, like cosegregation analysis in larger family cohorts, could help clarify its role across these subtypes.

Studies have shown a significant prevalence of this variant in affected individuals compared to controls, indicating its association with the disease (ID 5264). The variant has been found to cosegregate with VHL disease in multiple families, with affected members exhibiting phenotypes such as retinal hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytoma, and central nervous system hemangioblastomas, which are characteristic of VHL (IDs 5487, 5354, 5546).

      "The evidence from clinical trials supports the hypothesis that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the EGFR L858R mutation is more sensitive to erlotinib compared to standard chemotherapy. In the prospective study of 46 patients, those treated with erlotinib had an average progression-free survival (PFS) of 11 months, with a clinical benefit rate of 81%, indicating a strong response to the treatment. Similarly, the randomized phase 3 trial showed a median PFS of 9.7 months for the erlotinib group, significantly longer than the 5.2 months for the chemotherapy group. These results suggest that erlotinib is more effective in prolonging PFS in patients with EGFR mutations, including L858R.

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The claim that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the EGFR L858R mutation is sensitive to erlotinib is supported by multiple lines of evidence. Evidence ID 885 from a randomized phase 3 trial shows that NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, including L858R, had a significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) when treated with erlotinib compared to standard chemotherapy (9.7 months vs. 5.2 months). Additionally, evidence ID 4290 highlights a prospective study where patients with EGFR L858R mutations demonstrated a high clinical benefit rate and a PFS of 11 months with first-line erlotinib treatment. These findings are consistent with the known sensitivity of EGFR L858R mutations to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), as described in the molecular profile summary, which indicates that this mutation confers increased sensitivity to first and second-generation TKIs. Collectively, the evidence coherently supports the claim by demonstrating that erlotinib effectively targets the EGFR L858R mutation, leading to improved clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients.\"\n",

The mechanism of action of afatinib, an irreversible EGFR inhibitor, aligns with the known biology of EGFR mutations, providing a coherent explanation for its efficacy. While alternative treatments, such as other EGFR inhibitors, exist, afatinib's specific binding properties and clinical outcomes support its use as a targeted therapy for this mutation.

The hazard ratio for progression or death in the V600E group was 0.81 for dabrafenib-trametinib vs dabrafenib-alone. Of 179 V600E patients in the dabrafenib-trametinib group, 68% of patients had a response, which was 15 percentage points higher than in the dabrafenib-alone group (95% CI, 4 to 24; P=0.006).\n",

      "The COMBO-AD trial (ID 6178) demonstrated a significant reduction in relapse or death with a hazard ratio of 0.48 for the combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib compared to placebo, indicating a strong benefit in the adjuvant setting for stage III resected melanoma. In contrast, the COMBI-d trial (ID 6938) showed a more modest improvement in progression-free survival with a hazard ratio of 0.81 for the combination therapy compared to dabrafenib alone in patients with unresectable stage IIIC or IV melanoma. The differences in outcomes could be attributed to variations in patient populations, as COMBO-AD involved resected stage III patients, while COMBI-d included unresectable stage IIIC or IV patients. Additionally, the primary endpoints differed, with COMBO-AD focusing on relapse or death and COMBI-d on progression-free survival.

      "The evidence from the trials suggests that patients with the BRAF V600E mutation in metastatic melanoma show significant sensitivity to the combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib, as indicated by improved progression-free survival and response rates compared to monotherapy or vemurafenib. This sensitivity might be influenced by the specific targeting of the BRAF V600E mutation, which is a known driver mutation in melanoma, making these therapies particularly effective.

      "Generated answer:\n",
      "The evidence from the phase I study (ID 2953) supports the claim that NTRK1 fusions predict sensitivity to TRK inhibitors like Larotrectinib in solid tumors. The study shows that patients with NTRK fusions, despite having different heavily pretreated advanced diseases, responded well to the TRK inhibitor LOXO-101, with partial responses observed within 3-4 months and resolution of symptoms within two weeks. This aligns with other studies (IDs 6567 and 6568) where Larotrectinib demonstrated durable anti-tumor activity across various ages and tumor types, with high response rates in patients with NTRK fusions. The consistent effectiveness of TRK inhibitors in diverse tumor types with NTRK fusions suggests that these fusions are reliable predictors of sensitivity to such treatments. Therefore, the evidence collectively supports the notion that NTRK1 fusions are indicative of a positive response to Larotrectinib in solid tumors.\n",

While it correctly references the effectiveness of TRK inhibitors like Larotrectinib and LOXO-101 in treating tumors with NTRK fusions, it inaccurately claims that the evidence specifically supports NTRK1 fusions predicting sensitivity to Larotrectinib. The documents do not provide specific evidence that NTRK1 fusions alone predict sensitivity to Larotrectinib. Instead, they discuss NTRK fusions in general, including NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3, and their response to TRK inhibitors.

A total of eight patients had NTRK fusions, and by independent radiology review, all patients with TRK fusion were considered to have had an objective response. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion. Authors concluded that NTRK fusions may represent tissue and age agnostic oncogenic drivers, and that Larotrectinib was well tolerated in the patients and demonstrated activity in all tumors with NTRK fusions.\n",

Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09).

Median overall survival was found to differ by mutation, regardless of treatment. Median overall survival was 8.8 months (IQR 4.5-27) for patients with BRAF variants, 14.4 months (IQR 8.5-24.0) for patients with KRAS variants, and 20.1 months (IQR 11.5-31.7) for wildtype patients.

The study included 17 EHE patients with a median age of 48 years (range 25–68). FISH analysis confirmed the translocation t(1;3)(1p36.23;3q25.1) in all EHE cases, and breakpoints were mapped to within WWTR1 and CAMTA1. Using RT-PCR they confirmed the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in the three tumors that had suitable tissue available. Exon 4 of WWTR1 was found to be fused to either exon 8 or exon 9 of CAMTA1. Of note, this fusion was not found in any other benign or malignant epithelioid vascular tumors examined, including 13 epithelioid hemangiomas, five epithelioid angiosarcomas, and four epithelioid sarcoma-like EHE. The authors conclude that t(1;3)(p36.23;q25.1) is a consistent genetic abnormality in EHEs of different anatomical locations and grades of malignancy.\n",

      "To determine if the ACVR1 G328V mutation is a reliable biomarker for diagnosing diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) across different age groups and tumor types, additional evidence is needed in several areas. First, larger and more diverse cohort studies should be conducted to assess the prevalence of the ACVR1 G328V mutation across various age groups and tumor types beyond pediatric cases. Second, longitudinal studies are necessary to evaluate the mutation's prognostic value and its correlation with clinical outcomes. Third, comparative studies should be performed to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the ACVR1 G328V mutation as a biomarker compared to other known markers. Lastly, functional studies are needed to understand the biological mechanisms by which the mutation influences tumor behavior across different contexts.\n",

By PCR, the authors show strong increase in fold change of mRNA expression in downstream proteins of the ACVR1/BMP pathway, ID, ID2, ID3 and SNAI1 in ACVR1-mutant DIPG cell line compared to glioblastoma cells (KNS42 cells). These activating ACVR1 mutations were exclusively in midline high grade astrocytomas (P = 0.0040, Fisher's exact test).\n",

Five patients had G328V within the kinase domain. The ACVR1 G328V mutation was expressed using the pCDH511b vector in immortalized normal human astrocytes (iNHAs) where it activated downstream BMP signaling and enhanced cell growth.

Median overall survival was found to differ by mutation, regardless of treatment. Median overall survival was 8.8 months (IQR 4.5-27) for patients with BRAF variants, 14.4 months (IQR 8.5-24.0) for patients with KRAS variants, and 20.1 months (IQR 11.5-31.7) for wildtype patients.

The study included 17 EHE patients with a median age of 48 years (range 25–68). FISH analysis confirmed the translocation t(1;3)(1p36.23;3q25.1) in all EHE cases, and breakpoints were mapped to within WWTR1 and CAMTA1. Using RT-PCR they confirmed the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in the three tumors that had suitable tissue available. Exon 4 of WWTR1 was found to be fused to either exon 8 or exon 9 of CAMTA1. Of note, this fusion was not found in any other benign or malignant epithelioid vascular tumors examined, including 13 epithelioid hemangiomas, five epithelioid angiosarcomas, and four epithelioid sarcoma-like EHE.

      "Reasoning: The answer does not fully address the question because it lacks a direct comparison of the efficacy of vemurafenib and cobimetinib combination therapy to other targeted therapies in terms of progression-free and overall survival. While it provides some data on the combination therapy itself, it explicitly states that there is no information on other therapies, which is a crucial part of the question.

Of the 3 ZFTA::NCOA1 in-frame fusions identified, 2 contained 4 zinc finger C2H2 domains of ZFTA at the N-terminus fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1 at the C terminus.  The third only contained 1 zinc finger C2H2 domain of ZFTA fused to 2 transactivation domains and the histone acetyl transferase domains of NCOA1.

This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The claim that BRAF V600E mutant melanoma is sensitive to vemurafenib and cobimetinib combination therapy is supported by multiple pieces of evidence. In the coBRIM Phase III trial (ID 1421), patients with V600E mutations treated with the combination therapy showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to those receiving vemurafenib alone, with a hazard ratio of 0.57, indicating a 43% reduction in the risk of progression or death. This is consistent with the broader study results (ID 6044), where the combination therapy led to a median progression-free survival of 12.3 months versus 7.2 months for monotherapy, and a hazard ratio of 0.58. Additionally, the Phase 1b study (ID 6966) demonstrated that patients who had not previously received BRAF inhibitors had a high response rate to the combination therapy, with a median progression-free survival of 13.7 months. These findings align with the established understanding that BRAF V600E mutations are actionable targets in melanoma, and the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and cobimetinib, can effectively improve patient outcomes.\"\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The claim that BRAF V600K mutant melanoma is sensitive to vemurafenib and cobimetinib combination therapy is supported by evidence from multiple studies, though with varying degrees of effectiveness. In the coBRIM trial (ID 6965), the combination therapy showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to vemurafenib monotherapy, with a hazard ratio of 0.27, indicating a strong reduction in the risk of progression or death. However, the response rate in BRAF V600K patients treated with vemurafenib alone was lower compared to V600E patients treated with a different combination (ID 4181), suggesting that while the combination therapy is beneficial, it may not be as effective as other regimens for different mutations. The evidence is coherent in demonstrating the potential of the combination therapy, but it also highlights the need for further research to optimize treatment strategies for BRAF V600K mutations specifically. Overall, the evidence supports the claim, but with an understanding of its limitations and the need for additional comparative studies.\"\n",

Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.\n",

Mutation was detected in a VHL kindred with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, retinal hemangioblastomas and Grawitz tumor (also known as RCC) (case no. 2034). Protein length changes as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4). Patient's phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology (ACMG code: PP4).\n",
      "- ID 5340: Blood samples from 5 Japanese families revealed 4 germline mutations. This mutation was found in a family of 3 individuals (Family B). Only one patient in this family developed symtoms, which included a brain stem hemangioblastoma and retinal angioma discovered at age 30. Parents of this individual showed no manifestations of VHL disease and were negative for bands via single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis where the proband showed extra bands. This study contains moderate evidence of pathogenicity because the protein length changes as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4).\n",
      "- ID 6557: A prospective study followed 128 participants affected by VHL syndrome for 12 years in Padova, Italy. Individual patient data was not available, but frequency of specific mutations was presented. An in-frame deletion (TCT) at nucleotide 227 was present in 1 individual of the 122 total number of variants captured in this population.\n",
      "- ID 5386: A previous study of 26 Japanese, VHL families was extended to 41 additional families. Germline mutations were detected in 55 of 77 Japanese families. Renal cell carcinoma occurred predominantly in non-missense mutations predicted to lead to gross alteration or complete loss of the VHL protein. This mutation was found in a VHL type 1 patient with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, pancreatic cyst or tumor, and renal cell carcinoma (family ID 80).\n",
      "- ID 6121: Molecular analysis of VHL gene in 146 probands, 103 with and 43 without a positive family history, resulted in the detection of 43 germline VHL mutations. Majority of mutations were found in patients with classic or multi-organ manifestations of VHL disease, but mutations were also found in patients with limited or single-organ manifestations of VHL disease. Follow-up of families with germline mutations and limited VHL manifestations was recommended. This in-frame deletion variant was detected in a VHL type 2 patient with cerebellar hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, and epididymal cysts (family no. 24).\n",
      "- ID 5641: An investigation of 94 VHL patients without large deletions for intragenic mutations revealed 40 different mutations in 55 unrelated individuals. In all patients with multiple affected family members the missense mutation segregated with the disease. This mutation was found in 2 VHL type 1 patients (kindred no. 48, 75). Only moderate support for pathogenicity because protein length changes as a result of in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4).\n",
      "- ID 6862: Medical records of 26 patients diagnosed with VHL disease in two Korean hospitals between 2003-2012 and harboring germline VHL mutations were retrospectively reviewed. One male patient diagnosed with Type 1 VHL disease at 23Y (Patient 14) presented with renal cell carcinoma, multiple CNS hemangioblastomas and other manifestations. He had a germline inframe deletion in the VHL gene (c.227delTCT) and a negative family history of VHL disease.\n",
      "- ID 12004: In this 2020 study, the authors report two patients with BCOR::CCNB3 fusion-positive clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). Cases were males aged 10 and 14 years who presented with advanced disease. With initial testing, both cases were negative for a BCOR ITD. However, RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing were able to detect a BCOR::CCNB3 gene fusion. The authors concluded that all reports of CCSK with a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion have been detected in males older than the typical age (<4 years of age) of presentation for CCSK, and recommend testing for the BCOR::CCNB3 fusion in CCSK patients lacking a BCOR ITD or YWHAE::NUTM2 gene fusion.\n",
      "- ID 2955: LOXO-101 is an orally administered inhibitor of the TRK kinase and is highly selective only for the TRK family of receptors. The tumor of a 41-year-old woman with soft-tissue sarcoma metastatic to the lung was found to harbor an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 (exon 2 & exon 11) gene fusion encoding a functional LMNA-TRKA fusion oncoprotein. This patient's tumors underwent rapid and substantial tumor regression, with an accompanying improvement in pulmonary dyspnea, oxygen saturation, and plasma tumor markers.\n",
      "- ID 1273: In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.\n",

Evidence from studies ID 5750, 5386, and 6121 highlights the variant's association with these phenotypes, suggesting a pathogenic role. However, the evidence is not uniformly strong across all cases, as seen in ID 5340, where the variant was present in a family with limited disease expression, and ID 6862, where the patient had a negative family history. The variant's pathogenicity is further supported by its classification under ACMG code PM4, indicating a protein length change due to an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region. Overall, while the evidence supports the pathogenicity of the F76del variant, the variability in clinical presentation and family history suggests the need for further investigation to fully understand its role in VHL disease.\"\n",

Of 271 patients with nonsydromic pheochromocytoma and no family history of the disease, 30 mutations were found in VHL. Multiple pheochromocytomas were statistically more frequent among patients with mutations than among patients without mutations (21 of 66 vs. 5 of 205, P<0.001). This nonsense mutation was found in the VHL gene and one patient with pheochromocytoma. This study contains very strong evidence of pathogenicity in the form of a nonsense variant in a gene where loss-of-function is a known mechanism of disease (ACMG code: PVS1).\n",
      "- ID 5360: Of 65 VHL families from central Europe, 53 were identified with germline mutations.

      "- ID 12058: In this 2017 study, the authors utilized SNP arrays,  expression profiling, transcriptome, and whole-exome sequencing to further characterize sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS)/SEF hybrid tumors. The study included 13 tumors classified as pure SEF and six tumors from 4 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years. RNA-seq detected the EWSR1::CREB3L1 gene fusion in 8/13 pure SEF cases, with 2/13 positive for EWSR1::CREB3L2, and one each for FUS::CREM, FUS::CREB3L2, and PAX5::CREB3L1, while all hybrid tumors were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. SNP array showed both the pure SEF and hybrid tumors had multiple imbalances and structural rearrangements, and the authors suggest this could account for the poor outcome of SEF patients compared to LGFMS, which were found to be much less complex.\n",
      "- ID 12050: In this 2020 study, the authors included a total of 141 NUT carcinomas defined by rearrangement of NUTM1 detected by IHC, cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The median age at diagnosis was 24 years (range of 18 days to 80 years). Fusion partners were confirmed by either cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The majority  (78%) of tumors harbored a BRD4::NUTM1 fusion, 15% harbored a BRD3::NUTM1  fusion, 6% harbored a NSD3::NUTM1 fusion, 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF532::NUTM1 fusion and 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF592::NUTM1 fusion. For the remaining 14 cases the fusion partner gene to NUTM1 was not identified. The majority of tumors arose from the thorax or head and neck, but tumors were also seen in bone, soft tissue, and kidney.

First, the variant is repeatedly associated with a known mechanism of disease, where loss-of-function mutations in the VHL gene lead to the disease, as indicated by the ACMG code PVS1. The consistent observation of this variant across different studies and populations, such as in German and Hungarian families, and its absence in healthy controls, further supports its pathogenic role. Additionally, the variant's association with a range of VHL-related symptoms, including retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas and pheochromocytoma, aligns with the known clinical spectrum of VHL disease.

The study included 13 tumors classified as pure SEF and six tumors from 4 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years. RNA-seq detected the EWSR1::CREB3L1 gene fusion in 8/13 pure SEF cases, with 2/13 positive for EWSR1::CREB3L2, and one each for FUS::CREM, FUS::CREB3L2, and PAX5::CREB3L1, while all hybrid tumors were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. SNP array showed both the pure SEF and hybrid tumors had multiple imbalances and structural rearrangements, and the authors suggest this could account for the poor outcome of SEF patients compared to LGFMS, which were found to be much less complex.\n",

Thirteen FFPE samples of MC (9 females, 4 males) from ages 19 to 54 and Eighteen cases of meningeal HPC (8 females, 10 males) from ages from 24 to 73 years were tested using RT-PCR for the presence of HEY1-NCOA2 fusion. Of cases with evaluable RNA, 6/6 MC cases were positive for the fusion, but 0/11 meningeal HPC cases were fusion positive.\n",
      "- ID 7124: FISH was used to detect HEY1-NCOA2 fusions in 10 paraffin embedded samples from patients diagnosed with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. HEY1 and NCOA2 are located on the same chromosome but generate distinct FISH signals, whereas the HEY1-NCOA2 fusion appears as a single fused dot. Specimens were considered positive for fusion when FISH showed overlapping signals of HEY1 and NCOA2 in greater than 20% of the cells. Overlap signal of over 20% was seen in 8/10 patients. The two patients with no overlap signal were also negative for FISH staining, suggesting insufficient or damaged material for FISH.\n",
      "- ID 7017: 6 of 6 patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma and sufficient tissue tested positive for NCOA2 rearrangments by FISH supporting that NCOA2 rearrangements (presumably HEY1-NCOA2 translocations) are prevalent in this disease.\n",

The tumors showed low-grade histopathologic features and were broadly classified as diffuse astrocytoma (n = 11) or angiocentric glioma (n=35). Molecular alterations interrogated by immunohistochemistry (n=46), RNA sequencing (n=29), FISH (n=24), or PCR-based sequencing (n=11) revealed MYB (n=44) or MYBL1 (n=2) alterations in all tumors. MYB and MYBL1 were fused with various gene partners. None had alterations in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, ATRX, or histone H3 genes. Regardless of histopathologic diagnosis or anatomic location, DNA methylome profiling on 35 MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas formed a single cluster, supporting that MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas represent a single disease entity with a range of clinical and pathologic characteristics. Only MYB rearrangements were detected in angiocentric gliomas.

      "Gilteritinib exerts its effects on FLT3 D835 mutations primarily by inhibiting the kinase activity through interaction at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop. This allows gilteritinib to inhibit kinase activity despite the presence of the D835 mutation, as demonstrated by its ability to reduce phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells. In comparison to other FLT3 mutations or wildtype, gilteritinib shows a significantly lower IC50 for D835Y (1.6 nM) compared to controls (420 nM), indicating higher potency against the D835 mutation. In therapeutic outcomes, gilteritinib has shown antitumor efficacy and induced tumor regression in mouse models with D835Y mutations, and it was effective in a patient with FLT3-D835Y mutation after other treatments failed. This suggests that gilteritinib is particularly effective against FLT3 mutations involving D835, potentially due to its specific molecular interaction at the ATP-binding site.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

      "The phase 3 trials, including the J-ALEX study, demonstrate the superiority of alectinib over crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC by showing significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and better CNS response rates. In the J-ALEX trial, alectinib's median PFS was unreached compared to 10.2 months for crizotinib, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.31, indicating a substantial reduction in the risk of disease progression or death. Additionally, alectinib showed a higher CNS response rate, with 81% compared to 50% for crizotinib, and more patients achieving a complete CNS response. Potential biases or limitations could include the study population being limited to Japanese patients in the J-ALEX trial, which may affect generalizability, and the open-label design, which could introduce bias in reporting and assessment of outcomes.

      "- ID 4858: In a randomized, open-label phase 3 trial 303 patients with ALK-positive, previously untreated NSCLC (including asympt. CNS disease) were randomized to reiceive either Alectinib or Crizotinib. During a median follow-up of 17.6 months (crizotinib) and 18.6 months (alectinib), an event of disease progression/death occurred in 41% (62/152  pt) in the alectinib group and 68% (102/151 patients) in the crizotinib group. 12-month event-free survival rate 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib. A total of 18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an event of CNS progression, compared to 68 patients (45%) in the crizotinib group. Response rates were 82.9% (Alectinib) and 75.5% (crizotinib).\n",
      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",
      "- ID 1273: In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.\n",
      "- ID 7284: In a phase 3 trial, 303 patients with NSCLC with ALK fusion were randomly assigned to alectinib arm (N=152) or crizotinib arm (N=151). PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than with crizotinib (HR for disease progression or death 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.65, p<0.001). Investigator-assessed RR was 82.9% in alectinib arm and 75.5% in crizotinib arm. CNS RR in patients with measurable CNS lesions was 81% and 50% for alectinib and crizotinib, respectively. Eight patients in the alectinib group, in comparison to one patient with crizotinib, had a complete CNS response. Despite longer treatment duration for alectinib, there were fewer grade 3-5 adverse events compared with crizotinib treatment.\n",

ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.\n",
      "- ID 8657: A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).\n",
      "- ID 1691: In an evaluation of a patient with crizotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma, an EML4-ALK-E13;A20 rearrangement was identified using CGP.  The patient attained a reduction in the target lesions by 14.2%, however, the patient relapsed 17 months later.\n",
      "- ID 1665: 90 NSCLC patients with stage IIIB/IV chemotherapy-resistant tumors were treated with gefitinib, and the L858R EGFR mutation was associated with longer time to treatment failure than those with wild-type EGFR (median 9.1 versus 2.1). In multivariate analysis, L858R mutations plus adenocarcinoma was a significant predictive factor for time to treatment failure (HR = 0.1030; P = .0004).\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

Also, bone marrow myeloblast reduction was greater in FLT3 mutant patients compared to FLT3 wildtype.\n",
      "- ID 8923: This study was designed to test the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in vitro against FLT3-ITD and other TKD variants clinically observed. IC50s were determined from immunoblots quantifying FLT3 phosphorylation in endogenous (Molm14) or ectopic expression FLT3-ITD cell lines (TF-1, Ba/F3) and the endogenous wildtype FLT3 SEMK2 cell line after gilteritinib treatment. IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib. Additionally, plasma taken from 3 patients receiving 120mg of gilteritinib daily was able to inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation in Molm14 cells.\n",

Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001).

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined.

      "The study indicates that Gilteritinib is more effective in inhibiting FLT3 phosphorylation in FLT3-ITD mutations compared to wildtype FLT3, as evidenced by lower IC50 values (1.4 to 1.8 nM for FLT3-ITD versus 5 nM for wildtype). This suggests that FLT3-ITD mutations have increased sensitivity to Gilteritinib, likely due to specific molecular interactions that enhance the drug's binding or efficacy. The increased sensitivity in FLT3-ITD mutations implies that Gilteritinib can more effectively disrupt downstream signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and survival in these mutations, leading to better treatment outcomes. In contrast, the higher IC50 in wildtype FLT3 suggests less effective inhibition, which could contribute to reduced efficacy and potential resistance development in non-ITD mutations. These differences highlight the importance of targeting specific mutations for optimal treatment efficacy and minimizing resistance.\n",

      "- ID 7728: In this phase 3 trial (ADMIRAL), 371 patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML (required to have FLT3 ITD or TKD D835 or I836 mutations) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either gilteritinib (n=247, at a dose of 120 mg per day) or salvage chemotherapy (n=124). Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy.\n",
      "- ID 7283: In a phase 1/2 trial, patients with refractory or relapsed AML with FLT3 mutation (n=191; ITD n=162, D835 n=13, ITD-D835 n=16) received gilteritinib. 49% (93/191) of patients achieved an overall response, 9% (n=18) complete remission, 5% (n=10) complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery, 22% (n=42) complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery, and 12% (n=23) reached partial remission. The refractory or relapsed AML FLT wildtype group treated with gilteritinib(n=58) had lower overall response rate (12%), complete remission (2%), complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (0%), complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery (7%), and fewer reached partiral remission (3%). Also, bone marrow myeloblast reduction was greater in FLT3 mutant patients compared to FLT3 wildtype.\n",
      "- ID 8923: This study was designed to test the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in vitro against FLT3-ITD and other TKD variants clinically observed. IC50s were determined from immunoblots quantifying FLT3 phosphorylation in endogenous (Molm14) or ectopic expression FLT3-ITD cell lines (TF-1, Ba/F3) and the endogenous wildtype FLT3 SEMK2 cell line after gilteritinib treatment. IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib. Additionally, plasma taken from 3 patients receiving 120mg of gilteritinib daily was able to inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation in Molm14 cells.\n",
      "- ID 8924: In vitro gilteritinib treatment of MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells, which endogenously express FLT3-ITD, showed growth suppression based on CellTiter GLO cytotoxicity assays with IC50 values of 0.92 nM (95% CI: 0.23–3.6 nM) and 2.9 nM (95% CI: 1.4–5.8 nM), respectively. Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15. Gilteritinib treated mice showed significantly less widespread disease at day 42 than control counterparts (N=10, p<0.001) and significantly improved survival (log-rank, p<0.001).\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: FLT3 ITD\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"Clinical trials and molecular studies have demonstrated that Gilteritinib, a Type I FLT3 inhibitor, effectively targets FLT3 ITD mutations in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The evidence shows that Gilteritinib binds to the active conformation of the FLT3 receptor, inhibiting its kinase activity and leading to reduced proliferation of leukemic cells. This supports the claim that FLT3 ITD mutations are sensitive to Gilteritinib, as the drug's mechanism of action aligns with the observed clinical outcomes of improved patient responses. However, it is important to consider potential resistance mechanisms that may arise, which could affect the long-term efficacy of Gilteritinib. Overall, the evidence coherently supports the claim, though ongoing research is necessary to fully understand and address any emerging resistance.\"\n",

Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).\n",

RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 8917: All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",
      "- ID 8931: The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",

      "The clinical outcomes of ETV6-NTRK3–positive B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia patients treated with larotrectinib suggest that it can be an effective targeted treatment, especially when other therapies have failed. In the case of the 61-year-old man, larotrectinib led to a rapid reduction in peripheral blood blasts and resolution of lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis, achieving significant clinical benefit without apparent side effects, although the patient eventually succumbed to an unrelated infection. For the 6-year-old boy, larotrectinib, in combination with other drugs, achieved molecular remission in both bone marrow and CNS, even after other conventional therapies, including CAR-T cells, were ineffective. These outcomes indicate that larotrectinib can induce remission in ETV6-NTRK3–positive B-cell ALL, suggesting its potential as a targeted treatment, particularly for patients who do not respond to standard therapies. However, the need for continuous treatment and the occurrence of relapses upon pausing the drug highlight the importance of sustained therapy and further research into long-term efficacy and resistance mechanisms.\n",

      "- ID 7993: Case report of a 61-year-old man with B-ALL. An initial analysis detected the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion and a NRASGly12Asp mutation. Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).\n",
      "- ID 8930: Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis of a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk) revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 8917: All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",
      "- ID 8931: The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 6099: Four out of six patients with infantile fibrosarcoma and a ETV6-NTRK3 fusion had a partial response, the remaining two had a complete response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",
      "- ID 7290: In a large-scale international study RNA sequencing was performed to delineate the transcriptome landscape of 1,223 B-cell ALL cases. Twenty two cases were found to have P80R misense mutation in the DNA-binding domain of the PAX5 transcription factor gene. The P80R cases had unique expression profile and did not have any other known key driver mutations. The P80R is proposed to define a specific molecular/genetic subtype of B-ALL.   .\n",

Patient 1 presented with retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH) in her left eye at age the age of 13, which was treated with radiation. At age 62 years, this eye had good visual acuity (20/20) without any RCHs. As of her last visit, patient 1 also presented with abnormalities in the CNS, pancreas and kidney.

This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript (AF010238.1). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot.

      "The context does not provide specific prevalence rates for the L184P (c.551T>C) variant in the general population or in patients diagnosed with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) Disease. However, it mentions that this variant was found in three patients with VHL disease and none in 96 control cases, suggesting a higher prevalence in affected individuals compared to the general population. This significant difference in prevalence supports the variant's pathogenicity, as indicated by ACMG code PS4. The absence of the variant in control cases and its presence in multiple VHL patients strengthens the argument against it being a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS), suggesting it is likely pathogenic. However, without specific prevalence data, a comprehensive assessment of its significance as a VUS cannot be fully determined.\n",

Patient 1 presented with retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH) in her left eye at age the age of 13, which was treated with radiation. At age 62 years, this eye had good visual acuity (20/20) without any RCHs. As of her last visit, patient 1 also presented with abnormalities in the CNS, pancreas and kidney. She was found to have the L184P (c.551T>C) mutation. Her last known age was 69 years old. ACMG evidence codes: 'PP4' since the patient presents phenotypes highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 6119: Thirty-five unrelated patients suspected of having von Hippel-Lindau disease had genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes analyzed using sequence analysis of the coding region for VHL / Southern blot analyses. 32 VHL gene variants were found in 35 patients. An association of clear cell renal carcinoma development with a relatively high loss of structural stability in VHL protein missense mutations was discovered, although this only reached significance when combining data from other studies (p=0.101 for present study; p=0.0086 for present study + other study data). This missense variant was found in a patient with spinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, retinal hemangioblastomas, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, and cysts of the broad ligament (patient no. F43). The patient was 27 years old. ACMG PP4 as patient's phenotypes are highly specific for VHL disease.\n",

This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript (AF010238.1). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot.

      "- ID 9177: This retrospective study intended to clarify clinical characteristics of patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL) and kinase fusions that are not well described (excluding ETV6-RUNX1, E2A-PBX1, MLL rearrangements and BCR-ABL). The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is rare; in this study investigating 373 high risk pediatric B-ALL patients of which 29 demonstrated uncommon kinase gene fusions, only one case with SNX2-ABL1 (exon 3-exon 4) was observed. Gene expression profiles were compared to Ph-positive B-ALL and reportedly all fusion-containing samples (except P2RY8-CRLF2) were similar to BCR-ABL1-positive patients. This patient did not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered in combination with chemotherapy at the first or second relapses.\n",
      "- ID 7744: This case report describes a 7-year old boy with B-ALL who presented with high white blood count (115.4x109 /L). Karyotype analysis showed a t(5;9)(q22;q34), resulting in a SNX2-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated based on the ALL-BFM95 regimen; although he received remission, he relapsed during maintenance, 15 months after the initial diagnosis. He could not achieve the second remission using chemotherapy, but was treated at this time with imatinib (dose of 240 mg/m2 /d once daily); this allowed to achieve disease control and proceed with an umbilical cord blood transplant. However, at 6 months from transplantation, the patient developed bone marrow relapse again. He never achieved a remission after the second relapse (despite salvage chemotherapies and therapy with both imatinib and dasatinib). The patient died of progressive disease.\n",
      "- ID 7241: A 7-yr-old boy with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia was found to harbor the SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene. Gene expression analysis showed enrichment for BCR-ABL1+ ALL using GSEA. After first relapse (15 months after diagnosis) the patient was given imatinib at a dose of 240 mg/m2/d once daily and his disease stabilized for 2 months. The patient received dasatinib (80 mg/m2/d once daily) after an umbilical cord blood transplant and did not respond to treatment. Patient was put back on imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/m2/d once daily which rapidly decreased the number of blast cells. However, 6 months after transplant he had bone marrow relapse and did not again achieve remission by the time of reporting.\n",
      "- ID 9178: In the study involving 1725 B-ALL patients, 264 were identified by microarray-based algorithm to have a Ph-like expression signature. Next generation sequencing (RNAseq, WGS, and/or WES) performed on 154 Ph-like patients revealed 91% possessed genomic alterations activating kinase signaling with 96 (62%) involving rearrangements. In one adolescent male, an in-frame SNX2-ABL1 fusion (exon 3 and exon 4) with the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain intact was identified and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger. This patient, evaluated by WES and RNA-seq, also harbored IKZF1, EBF1, and VPREB deletions, and was designated Ph-like non CRLF2.\n",
      "- ID 10337: Molecular analysis of 30 Ewing tumors (designated as Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) in this 1994 paper) from patients with well-documented clinical course was performed.   RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28).  Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses.  19 of 28 (67%) were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex6 (type I), 4 of 28  (14%)  were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex5 (type II) and there was 1 each of EWSR1 ex7:: FLI1 ex7, EWSR1 ex 10::FLI1 ex 5, and EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4.  This last tumor (EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4) had evidence of an additional 4 splicing variants corresponding to EWSR1 exon 7 to FLI1 exons 4, 6, 8 and 9.  Two tumors had EWSR1::ERG with breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG.  Of note, karyotyping only revealed a chromosome 22 rearrangement in 18 out of 27 cases tested (67%), however this was thought to be due to failure to obtain mitotic figures (5 of 9) and insufficient  material (4 of 9).  Authors conclude RT-PCR is better than karyotyping for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors. In this small study, EWSR::FLI1 type I fusion predominated over type II in localized Ewing's and were more abundant in tumors affecting the long bones (9 versus 0), however no correlations between different EWSR1 transcripts and any other clinical parameters could be identified.\n",
      "- ID 11784: In this 2016 study Kenny et al. included 159 cases of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). RNA was extracted from either snap-frozen or FFPE tumour tissue samples and real-time PCR used to identify YWHAE::NUTM2 fusions. Of the 102 cases tested, 2 (2%) were positive for the YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript. The two cases were both aged less than a year (mean of 9 months), both male, and disease stage II or III/IV.  The YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript is present in only a minority of CCSKs, however the observation of the same rearrangement in high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, suggests this translocation is oncogenic.\n",

      "Additional Information:\n",
      "- Molecular Profile: ABL1 SNX2::ABL1\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

      "The SNX2-ABL1 fusion contributes to the pathogenesis of Ph-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia by creating a chimeric protein that retains the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain, leading to constitutive kinase activation. This aberrant kinase activity promotes uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival, similar to other kinase fusions in Ph-like B-ALL, which also activate kinase signaling pathways. These fusions often result in the activation of downstream signaling cascades such as the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, contributing to leukemogenesis. The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is comparable to other kinase fusions in that it involves rearrangements that lead to the activation of kinase signaling, a common feature in 91% of Ph-like B-ALL cases with genomic alterations. However, the specific partner gene and the resulting fusion protein's structure can influence the exact downstream effects and therapeutic responses.\n",

      "The presence of additional genomic alterations, such as IKZF1, EBF1, and VPREB deletions, in patients with SNX2-ABL1 fusions can complicate the clinical outcomes and treatment responses. These alterations are often associated with poor prognosis and resistance to standard therapies, as seen in the case of the 16-year-old male who did not respond well to treatment and eventually died of the disease. The evidence suggests that these genomic alterations contribute to the aggressive nature of Ph-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia, which is characterized by kinase signaling activation. The coherence of the evidence is supported by the consistent identification of these alterations in Ph-like B-ALL patients, indicating a common pathway of disease progression and resistance.

The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is rare; in this study investigating 373 high risk pediatric B-ALL patients of which 29 demonstrated uncommon kinase gene fusions, only one case with SNX2-ABL1 (exon 3-exon 4) was observed. Gene expression profiles were compared to Ph-positive B-ALL and reportedly all fusion-containing samples (except P2RY8-CRLF2) were similar to BCR-ABL1-positive patients. This patient did not respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors administered in combination with chemotherapy at the first or second relapses.\n",

Karyotype analysis showed a t(5;9)(q22;q34), resulting in a SNX2-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated based on the ALL-BFM95 regimen; although he received remission, he relapsed during maintenance, 15 months after the initial diagnosis. He could not achieve the second remission using chemotherapy, but was treated at this time with imatinib (dose of 240 mg/m2 /d once daily); this allowed to achieve disease control and proceed with an umbilical cord blood transplant. However, at 6 months from transplantation, the patient developed bone marrow relapse again. He never achieved a remission after the second relapse (despite salvage chemotherapies and therapy with both imatinib and dasatinib). The patient died of progressive disease.\n",

Gene expression analysis showed enrichment for BCR-ABL1+ ALL using GSEA. After first relapse (15 months after diagnosis) the patient was given imatinib at a dose of 240 mg/m2/d once daily and his disease stabilized for 2 months. The patient received dasatinib (80 mg/m2/d once daily) after an umbilical cord blood transplant and did not respond to treatment. Patient was put back on imatinib at a dose of 600 mg/m2/d once daily which rapidly decreased the number of blast cells. However, 6 months after transplant he had bone marrow relapse and did not again achieve remission by the time of reporting.\n",

      "- ID 10337: Molecular analysis of 30 Ewing tumors (designated as Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) in this 1994 paper) from patients with well-documented clinical course was performed.   RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28).  Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses.  19 of 28 (67%) were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex6 (type I), 4 of 28  (14%)  were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex5 (type II) and there was 1 each of EWSR1 ex7:: FLI1 ex7, EWSR1 ex 10::FLI1 ex 5, and EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4.  This last tumor (EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4) had evidence of an additional 4 splicing variants corresponding to EWSR1 exon 7 to FLI1 exons 4, 6, 8 and 9.  Two tumors had EWSR1::ERG with breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG.  Of note, karyotyping only revealed a chromosome 22 rearrangement in 18 out of 27 cases tested (67%), however this was thought to be due to failure to obtain mitotic figures (5 of 9) and insufficient  material (4 of 9).  Authors conclude RT-PCR is better than karyotyping for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors. In this small study, EWSR::FLI1 type I fusion predominated over type II in localized Ewing's and were more abundant in tumors affecting the long bones (9 versus 0), however no correlations between different EWSR1 transcripts and any other clinical parameters could be identified.\n",
      "- ID 11784: In this 2016 study Kenny et al. included 159 cases of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). RNA was extracted from either snap-frozen or FFPE tumour tissue samples and real-time PCR used to identify YWHAE::NUTM2 fusions. Of the 102 cases tested, 2 (2%) were positive for the YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript. The two cases were both aged less than a year (mean of 9 months), both male, and disease stage II or III/IV.  The YWHAE::NUTM2 fusion transcript is present in only a minority of CCSKs, however the observation of the same rearrangement in high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, suggests this translocation is oncogenic.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ABL1 SNX2::ABL1\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",

This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript (AF010238.1). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot.

      "The evidence from the clinical trials and case studies supports the hypothesis that KANK1::NTRK2 positive tumors are sensitive to larotrectinib by demonstrating significant tumor reduction and clinical improvements in patients treated with the drug. In the pooled analysis of clinical trials, NTRK2 fusions, including KANK1::NTRK2, were associated with tumor size reduction in some cases. The case study of the 26-year-old man showed a significant reduction in tumor size and slight motor improvements after larotrectinib treatment, although disease progression was later observed. The 6-year-old boy's case demonstrated sustained clinical and radiographic response to larotrectinib over 10 months, with cognitive and motor improvements and no toxicity. However, an inconsistency arises in the 26-year-old's case where disease progression occurred despite initial response, and the KANK1::NTRK2 fusion was no longer detectable, suggesting potential resistance mechanisms or tumor heterogeneity that are not fully understood.\n",

      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",
      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",

      "  \"generated_explanation\": \"The claim that KANK1::NTRK2 positive tumors demonstrate sensitivity to larotrectinib is supported by evidence from clinical cases and trials. In the case of a 6-year-old boy with a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion, larotrectinib treatment led to significant cognitive and motor improvements and a sustained tumor response over 10 months (ID 10360). Similarly, a 26-year-old man with a glioblastoma harboring the same fusion showed a significant tumor reduction after larotrectinib treatment, although disease progression eventually occurred due to a different genetic driver (ID 10361). A pooled analysis of clinical trials further supports the efficacy of larotrectinib in NTRK fusion-positive tumors, including those with NTRK2 fusions (ID 10392). These pieces of evidence collectively suggest that larotrectinib is effective in targeting KANK1::NTRK2 fusions, aligning with the broader understanding of NTRK inhibitors' role in treating NTRK fusion-positive cancers. However, the evidence also highlights the potential for other genetic factors to influence treatment outcomes, underscoring the need for comprehensive molecular profiling in clinical practice.\"\n",

Using a thymidine incorporation assay, S249C expressing cells were shown to lose contact inhibition and grew 3x to 4x more rapidly than controls. Soft agar assays demonstrated increased colony formation and anchorage independent growth in S249C expressing cells versus controls.

      "The FGFR3 S249C mutation leads to increased tumor growth and colony formation through several mechanisms. It causes ligand-independent phosphorylation of FGFR3, resulting in enhanced signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and transformation, as evidenced by the loss of contact inhibition and rapid growth in NIH-3T3 cells. The mutation also increases dimer stability and alters dimer structure, although it does not induce constitutive dimerization. Additionally, the S249C mutation is associated with increased resistance to chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, through enhanced Akt signaling.

The mutation leads to ligand-independent phosphorylation, loss of contact inhibition, increased growth rates, and tumor formation in animal models, which are consistent with oncogenic behavior. Additionally, the mutation enhances dimer stability and alters dimer structure, which may contribute to its transforming properties. However, the data also show that S249C does not induce constitutive dimerization, suggesting that its oncogenic mechanism might differ from other mutations that do. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the structural modifications induced by S249C and their role in oncogenesis, as well as to explore the mutation's resistance to treatments like cisplatin, which could inform therapeutic strategies.\n",

      "- ID 8854: Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based technique acquired quantitative measurement of the effect of S249C on unliganded mutant FGFR3 dimer stability and structure in plasma membrane vesicles from CHO cells. Dimer stability was modestly increased by S249C (-3.7 kcal/mol) versus wildtype FGFR3 (-3.4 kcal/mol). Intrinsic FRET demonstrated S249C dimers were significantly closer together (45 A) than the wildtype dimer (53 A). The substitution of cysteine was expected to lead to strong covalent bonds, but the authors conclude their data demonstrates S249C does not induce constitutive FGFR3 dimerization, but induces dimer structural modifications.\n",
      "- ID 8642: Bladder cancer cell line 97-7 expressing endogenous FGFR3 S249C (IC50 44.6ug/ml) was resistant to cisplatin compared to two FGFR3 wild-type cell lines, 5637 (IC50 2.07ug/ml) and T24 (IC50 1.58ug/ml) as shown by a CCK-8 colorimetric cytotoxicity. Western blot revealed the ratio of phosphorylated-Akt/total Akt was higher in the 97-7 cells than in the wild-type cells, which was reversed by siRNA knockdown of FGFR3. Inhibition of Akt signaling by treatment with GDC0068 or LY294002 increased the cisplatin sensitivity of 97-7 cells (IC50 4.17ug/ml & 8.91ug/ml respectively).\n",

Xenograft assays showed similar results with all transforming FGFR3 mutations leading to increased tumor growth compared to wild-type.\n",
      "- ID 8853: In contrast to controls (empty vector and FGFR3 wildtype overexpression NIH-3T3 cell lines), the stable transfection of NIH-3T3 cells with FGFR3b-S249C led to ligand-independent phosphorylation of FGFR3 and the acquisition of elongated, refractile spindle-shaped morphology like transformed cells. Using a thymidine incorporation assay, S249C expressing cells were shown to lose contact inhibition and grew 3x to 4x more rapidly than controls. Soft agar assays demonstrated increased colony formation and anchorage independent growth in S249C expressing cells versus controls. All nude mice subcutaneously injected with S249C cells rapidly formed tumors, but no tumors were observed in empty vector injected mice. The authors conclude mutated FGFR3b-S249C has transforming properties attributed to oncogenes.\n",

      "Larotrectinib, a highly selective TRK inhibitor, exerts its effects on ETV6::NTRK3-positive infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) tumors by targeting the constitutively active TRK signaling pathway resulting from the ETV6–NTRK3 gene fusion. This fusion leads to continuous activation of TRK receptors, promoting tumor growth and survival. By inhibiting TRK, larotrectinib disrupts this signaling, leading to tumor regression. Similar mechanisms are observed in other tumors with NTRK gene fusions, where larotrectinib effectively blocks aberrant TRK signaling, resulting in tumor shrinkage and clinical responses. The drug's efficacy across different tumor types with NTRK fusions highlights its role in targeting a common oncogenic driver.\n",

      "The evidence from the reported cases of KANK1::NTRK2 fusion in sarcoma and glioblastoma multiforme supports the classification of this fusion as oncogenic. In the sarcoma case, the presence of the KANK1::NTRK2 fusion was associated with high-grade morphology and aggressive behavior, suggesting an oncogenic role. Similarly, in the glioblastoma multiforme case, the fusion was detected in a tumor that was not identified by standard screening but was confirmed through RNA analysis, indicating its potential significance in tumor development. Additionally, the pilocytic astrocytoma case with the KANK1-NTRK2 fusion showed unusual tumor characteristics and progression, further supporting its oncogenic potential. Alternative explanations for the observed tumor characteristics could include other genetic or epigenetic factors contributing to tumor behavior, but the consistent presence of the fusion across different tumor types suggests a direct oncogenic role.\n",

The patient had a history of hemimelia in the same limb as the congenital fibrosarcoma, but no known family history and no known prenatal exposures. Because the typical ETV6::NTRK3 fusion was not found, more extensive molecular profiling was done. A t(2;15)(p21;q24) translocation was identified by cytogenetics and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) showed clear copy-number transitions within EML4 and NTRK3. An EML4::NTRK3 (e2::e14) fusion was confirmed by RNA sequencing. This fusion was in-frame with breakpoints at exon 2 of EML4 and exon 14 of NTRK3. Stable lentiviral transduction of this fusion into NIH-3T3 cells induced soft agar colony growth in vitro and tumors in vivo. Based on similar positive cellular transformation and functional motifs to the typically found ETV6::NTRK3, the authors conclude other fusion partners like EML4::NTRK3 can contribute to the development of congenital fibrosarcoma.\n",

A novel NTRK3 break-apart probe set detected an NTRK3 rearrangement in 34/58 cases tested, including 25/26 infantile fibrosarcomas. In 46 cases tested, a novel EML4::NTRK3 dual fusion FISH probe set detected the fusion in 1 infantile fibrosarcoma case (case 58; 1 years old) known to harbor the EML4::NTRK3 fusion and a new case (case 3; 7 months), both with histology typical for what is observed in ETV6::NTRK3 infantile fibrosarcoma.

IC50s were determined from immunoblots quantifying FLT3 phosphorylation in endogenous (Molm14) or ectopic expression FLT3-ITD cell lines (TF-1, Ba/F3) and the endogenous wildtype FLT3 SEMK2 cell line after gilteritinib treatment. IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib. Additionally, plasma taken from 3 patients receiving 120mg of gilteritinib daily was able to inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation in Molm14 cells.\n",

      "The evidence supporting ETV6::NTRK3 as an oncogenic fusion in multiple cancer types is compelling, particularly in the context of aggressive lymphoid leukemia in mice and B-cell ALL in humans, as demonstrated by the development of leukemia and CNS infiltration in Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice and the remission achieved with Larotrectinib in a human patient. However, compared to the well-established ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, which is a common and well-characterized driver in leukemia, ETV6::NTRK3 is less extensively studied and documented across diverse cancer types. The explanatory power of ETV6::NTRK3 could be strengthened by additional studies demonstrating its presence and oncogenic role in a broader range of cancers, as well as further mechanistic insights into its function. Longitudinal studies showing consistent clinical outcomes and responses to targeted therapies like Larotrectinib across larger patient cohorts would also bolster its standing.

      "- ID 11519: RNA-seq transcriptome analysis in a discovery cohort of 170 B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL)  cases negative for the common classifying cytogenetic aberrations identified several well-defined hierarchical expression clusters. Four clusters corresponded to known oncogenic subtypes, namely ZNF384, ERG/DUX4, BCR::ABL1-like, and KMT2A/MLL-rearranged. An additional cluster comprised 14 cases (8.2%), which lacked any fusion gene. Mutational analysis of RNA-seq data revealed the presence of a unique PAX5 mutation, c.239C>G, p.Pro80Arg (p.P80R), in all cases. In an additional cohort of 419 unselected BCP-ALL cases, PAX5 P80R was identified in 16 (5.3%). The authors conclude that the PAX5 P80R variant, with its distinct transcriptional signature, defines a subtype of BCP-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 7291: Integrated genomic analysis was performed for 1,988 childhood and adult B-ALL cases. Forty four cases (2.2%) showed the P80R substitution in the DNA binding domain for the PAX5 transcription factor gene. These cases were characterized by a unique expression profile. In the majority of the cases the mutation was hemizygous or homozygous, owing to deletion of the wild-type PAX5 allele or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. In 96% (42 of 44) of cases, the PAK5 P80R was accompanied by RAS and/or JAK-STAT signaling-pathway alterations (such as NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, NF1, IL7R), thereby suggesting cooperativity between deregulated PAX5 activity and kinase signaling.  The PAX5 P80R is proposed to define a distinct subtype of B-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 7290: In a large-scale international study RNA sequencing was performed to delineate the transcriptome landscape of 1,223 B-cell ALL cases. Twenty two cases were found to have P80R misense mutation in the DNA-binding domain of the PAX5 transcription factor gene. The P80R cases had unique expression profile and did not have any other known key driver mutations. The P80R is proposed to define a specific molecular/genetic subtype of B-ALL.   .\n",

Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop. This inhibitory mechanism allows for kinase inhibition to occur in the face of D835 mutation.\n",

Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09).

Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy.\n",

Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations.

Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days.

Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",

The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",
      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",

The study included 13 tumors classified as pure SEF and six tumors from 4 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years. RNA-seq detected the EWSR1::CREB3L1 gene fusion in 8/13 pure SEF cases, with 2/13 positive for EWSR1::CREB3L2, and one each for FUS::CREM, FUS::CREB3L2, and PAX5::CREB3L1, while all hybrid tumors were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion.

A total of 18 cases included 10 cases of pure SEF and 8 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The overall mean age at diagnosis was 44 years (range 18–78). The pure SEF cases were found to have the well-known EWSR1::CREB3L1 fusion in 6/10 cases, a previously unidentified EWSR1::CREB3L2 fusion in 2/10 cases, a FUS rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10, and  an EWSR1 rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10 case.  On the other hand, the hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors all showed the presence of a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. The authors conclude identification of different fusions by gene-specific FISH probes can confirm differences underlying the histologically different pure SEF (mostly EWSR1 rearranged) from LGFMS variants (mainly FUS rearranged).\n",

Patients with SEF ranged from 28 to 91 years of age. Using RT-PCR, they detected in-frame fusions in 3/4 cases with suitable samples, joining either exon 7, 8, or 11 of EWSR1 to exon 6 of CREB3L1. Split signals at EWSR1 and CREB3L1 were detected by FISH in an additional case. All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement. The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.\n",

      "- ID 11603: An analysis of 85 small blue round cell tumors (SBRCTs) that were negative for EWSR1, CIC, or BCOR by FISH identified 6 FUS::ERG and 1 FUS::FEV fusions.  Clinicopathologic characterization of these 7 cases with FUS fusions and 8 FUS-rearranged SBRCTs reported in the literature described the morphology as monomorphic round cell cytomorphology (keeping with a classic Ewing sarcoma phenotype) with diffuse membranous CD99 reactivity in all except one case with patchy staining.  Of note, there were 4 patients in this group who had scored negative for EWSR1 FISH that were positive for EWSR1::ERG  by other means (FusionSeq, RT-PCR, etc.) and the authors caution of the false negatives with EWSR1 FISH due to the complexity of the the EWSR1::ERG rearrangement.  The authors conclude that these rarer alternative fusions also lead to classic Ewing sarcoma.\n",

RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28).  Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses.   The two tumors with EWSR1::ERG had breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG with a t(2;22) rearrangement detected in 1 of these 2 cases by karyotyping.  Authors conclude RT-PCR is a sensitive method for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile: ALK Fusion\n",
      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

Of 16 patients with measurable CNS disease, four achieved CNS complete response and 8 showed CNS partial response. median duration of CNS response was 11.1 months. 2 deaths were observed, and 1 was judged related to study treatment.\n",
      "- ID 7284: In a phase 3 trial, 303 patients with NSCLC with ALK fusion were randomly assigned to alectinib arm (N=152) or crizotinib arm (N=151). PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than with crizotinib (HR for disease progression or death 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.65, p<0.001). Investigator-assessed RR was 82.9% in alectinib arm and 75.5% in crizotinib arm. CNS RR in patients with measurable CNS lesions was 81% and 50% for alectinib and crizotinib, respectively. Eight patients in the alectinib group, in comparison to one patient with crizotinib, had a complete CNS response. Despite longer treatment duration for alectinib, there were fewer grade 3-5 adverse events compared with crizotinib treatment.\n",
      "- ID 1273: In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.\n",
      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",
      "- ID 1279: In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.\n",
      "- ID 8657: A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).\n",

RNA isolated from an EHE with the known t(1;3)(p36;q25) translocation underwent whole-transcriptome sequencing and they detected a fusion that contained exon 2 of WWTR1 fused to exon 9 of CAMTA1. Using RT-PCR they confirmed the presence of the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in another 4 cases of t(1;3)(p36;q25) positive EHE. The fusion involved either exon 2 (type 1 fusion transcript) or exon 3 (type 2 fusion transcript) of WWTR1 in-frame to exon 9 of CAMTA1. To determine the incidence of WWTR1::CAMTA1 they performed FISH with break-apart probes that flanked the WWTR1 or CAMTA1 gene regions on 47 EHE samples. The analysis detected CAMTA1 rearrangement in 39 of 45 EHE tumors (87%) and 42 of 47 (89%) harbored a rearrangement of the WWTR1 gene region, while all other vascular tumors were negative. The authors conclude that the gene fusion is exclusively present in almost all EHEs, demonstrating it to be a disease-defining genetic alteration.\n",

The study included 17 EHE patients with a median age of 48 years (range 25–68). FISH analysis confirmed the translocation t(1;3)(1p36.23;3q25.1) in all EHE cases, and breakpoints were mapped to within WWTR1 and CAMTA1. Using RT-PCR they confirmed the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in the three tumors that had suitable tissue available. Exon 4 of WWTR1 was found to be fused to either exon 8 or exon 9 of CAMTA1. Of note, this fusion was not found in any other benign or malignant epithelioid vascular tumors examined, including 13 epithelioid hemangiomas, five epithelioid angiosarcomas, and four epithelioid sarcoma-like EHE. The authors conclude that t(1;3)(p36.23;q25.1) is a consistent genetic abnormality in EHEs of different anatomical locations and grades of malignancy.\n",

The patients' ages ranged from 9 to 85 years. For the 35 samples they were able to test successfully, 33 were positive for WWTR1::CAMTA1 (94%) and 2 were positive for YAP1::TFE3 (6%). There were 8 cases with a detected fusion gene via RT-PCR that were negative with FISH testing, and 3 cases negative with RT-PCR that had a positive FISH result. Exon 4 of WWTR1 was fused to CAMTA1 exon 8 in 13 cases and exon 9 in 7 cases, and exon 3 of WWTR1 was fused to CAMTA1 exon 9 in 3 cases.

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

Across the combined tRCC cohort, the majority of cases (88.6%) harbored TFE3 fusions with 12 different fusion partners identified.  ASPSCR1 (13), SFPQ (13), PRCC (13), NONO (5), MED15 (4), RBM10 (4) were recurrent partners while U2AF2, MATR3, LUC7L3, KHSRP, FUBP1, and DVL2 were each seen in 1 case.  All fusions analyzed preserve the helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper domain  of the TFE3 transcription factor, which is critical for dimerization and DNA binding.\n",
      "- ID 10150: This study screened 983 Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) cases and identified 65 tumors with morphologic features suspicious of RCC with Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion (Xp11.2 RCC). TFE3 immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing confirmed 22 of these (34%) were Xp11.2 RCC.  TFE3 rearrangements define RCCs with Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion, which, in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, further belongs to the category of \"MiT family translocation renal cell carcinoma.\" The MiT family (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor family) translocation RCC comprises of the Xp11 translocation RCC harboring TFE3 gene fusions and the t(6;11) renal cell carcinoma harboring TFEB gene fusion. This study showed that the Xp11.2 translocation/TFE3 gene fusion RCC can be difficult to diagnose by pathology, and that evaluation by FISH is a useful diagnostic tool for this tumor type.\n",

The other two cases were assumed to have the ASPSCR1::TFE3 gene fusion. The ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion in one cases was confirmed by RT-PCR. Likewise, the PRCC::TFE3 fusion was detected by RT-PCR and confirmed by direct sequencing. Of the 199 samples, for which the karyotype was not determined 3 cases were assumed Xp11 translocation by positive immunostaining for TFE3.\n",

(2016) included a total of 60 cases with known TFE3 gene rearrangements in this study of Xp11 translocation positive neoplasms (47 RCC, 8 PEComa, and 5 melanotic renal cancers). The age range for the RCC cases was 5 to 73 years. Fusion partners of TFE3 were identified using FISH (with confirmation by RNA sequencing in 5 cases) for 41/47 RCC cases, and included 7 SFPQ::TFE3 (PSF), 16 PRCC::TFE3, 12 ASPSCR1::TFE3 (ASPL), 5 NONO::TFE3, and 1 DVL2::TFE3. For the remaining 6 cases, the fusion partner of TFE3 was unable to be determined.

(2001) included eight morphologically distinctive renal cell carcinomas with the t(X;17) translocation as seen in alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), with the distinction that the t(X;17) translocation is cytogenetically balanced in these renal tumors. The patients ranged from 17 months to 17 years of age. RT-PCR performed on the extracted RNA identified the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion product in all eight cases. Seven of the cases contained the type 1 product, a fusion of ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 4, whereas one cases showed a type 2 product, a fusion of ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 3.   These cases were initially diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) but upon further analysis were recognized to contain similarities to ASPS, likely due to the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion suggesting they are a distinctive subset of RCC. Of note, ASPSCR1::TFE3 is referred to by the alternative name ASPL-TFE3 in this paper.\n",

(2005) included 7 renal neoplasms with cytogenetic and/or molecular evidence of the t(6;11)(p21;q12). The patients ranged from 9 to 33 years in age. All of the 7 renal neoplasms demonstrated either moderate or strong nuclear immunoreactivity for TFEB protein, and 1089 other neoplasms were tested but none showed significant labeling for TFEB. In 3 cases frozen tissue was available for RNA extraction, and RT-PCR detected the MALAT1(Alpha0::TFEB fusion. The potentially wide size range of MALAT1(Alpha)::TFEB fusion transcripts complicates the detection of this fusion by RT-PCR for robust detection in clinical RNA samples. The lack of splice signals in Alpha resulted in DNA PCR products of the same size as the RT-PCR products when the reverse primer binds to TFEB exon 3. The authors conclude that immunoreactivity for TFEB protein is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for these renal neoplasms and suggest that long-range DNA PCR may a useful alternative to RT-PCR due to the special molecular features of the Alpha::TFEB gene fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11535: Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) with t(6;11)(p21;q12) are extremely rare and are characterized by a specific chromosome translocation involving the transcription factor EB (TFEB). Identification of either overexpression of the TFEB protein or translocation is a useful method for the diagnosis of TFEB RCCs. However, the results of immunostainings can be inconsistent. This 2012 study included 7 genetically confirmed cases of this rare tumor. The patients’ ages ranged from 21 to 37 years.  All of these tumors showed moderate to strong immunoreactivity for TFEB. DNA PCR performed on genomic DNA extracted from FFPE tissue samples of the tumor identified the Alpha::TFEB fusion gene in 2 cases.  The TFEB partner gene MALAT1 (Alpha) is an intronless, untranslated (non-protein coding) gene of unknown function. The Alpha::TFEB fusion genes were not identified in the other 5 cases. Using a FISH split probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs showed a high percentage of cells with separation signals, and using a fusion probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs demonstrated fusion signals. They concluded that the diagnosis of such tumors should be based not only on morphology itself but also on immunophenotype and molecular genetic findings.\n",
      "- ID 11534: Bakouny, et al. (2022) performed a comprehensive study of the molecular and clinical features of translocation renal cell carcinomas (tRCCs), defined as subtype of kidney cancer driven by MiT/TFE gene fusions. Across the combined tRCC cohort, the majority of cases (78 cases; 88.6%) harbored TFE3 fusions, while the remainder harbored TFEB (8 cases; 9.1%) or MITF (2 cases; 2.3%) fusions.  Four different TFEB fusion partners were observed including CADM2, CLTC, COL21A1 and MALAT1. TFEB and MITF fusion partners tended to preserve less of the N-terminal fusion partner in the fusion product compared to TFE3. The authors conclude that most tRCCs harbor few somatic alterations apart from MiT/TFE fusions.\n",

Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses.  19 of 28 (67%) were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex6 (type I), 4 of 28  (14%)  were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex5 (type II) and there was 1 each of EWSR1 ex7:: FLI1 ex7, EWSR1 ex 10::FLI1 ex 5, and EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4.  This last tumor (EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4) had evidence of an additional 4 splicing variants corresponding to EWSR1 exon 7 to FLI1 exons 4, 6, 8 and 9.  Two tumors had EWSR1::ERG with breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG.  Of note, karyotyping only revealed a chromosome 22 rearrangement in 18 out of 27 cases tested (67%), however this was thought to be due to failure to obtain mitotic figures (5 of 9) and insufficient  material (4 of 9).  Authors conclude RT-PCR is better than karyotyping for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors. In this small study, EWSR::FLI1 type I fusion predominated over type II in localized Ewing's and were more abundant in tumors affecting the long bones (9 versus 0), however no correlations between different EWSR1 transcripts and any other clinical parameters could be identified.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).\n",

All patients diagnosed with de novo AML (337 children and 1,460 adults) or secondary AML (22 children and 119 adults) received comparable therapy. The study concluded that patients with different cytogenetic abnormalities can be divided into 3 prognostic subgroups with favorable, intermediate, and adverse outcomes solely based on the results of cytogenetics.

Morphologic characteristics highly enriched in cases positive for t(8;21) included irregular nuclear shape, Auer bodies, at least 90% myeloperoxidase positivity in blast cells, pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly of the nuclei, and homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils. These features were observed in 90-100% of the t(8;21) positive cases and were rare in the t(8;21) negative group. Homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils was the most characteristic of t(8;21)positive AML-M2, while pale-colored cytoplasm without any granules in mature neutrophils or dyserythropoietic features was never observed in association with t(8;21). The study suggests association of the t(8;21) with a subtype of AML that has morphologically recognizable features in a high proportion of cases.  Of note, AML with t(8;21) translocation is now known to result in a RUNX1::RUNX1T fusion.\n",

Using probes from the junction clone, the presence of this consistent junction region was confirmed in 9 independent cases of AML with t(8;21). The authors also isolated cDNA clones from a t(8;21) AML cDNA library that contained fused sequences from chromosomes 8 and 21. This allowed them to identify the chromosome 8 partner gene which they named ETO (currently known as RUNX1T1) and confirm the chromosome 21 partner as AML1 (currently RUNX1), which showed similarity with the Drosophila segmentation gene, runt. The consequence of the t(8;21) was determined to be the juxtaposition of 5' sequences of AML1 (RUNX1) to 3' sequences of ETO (RUNX1T1), oriented telomere to centromere on the der(8) chromosome. The study confirms that t(8;21) consistently results in an oncogenic fusion between specific partner genes, confirming its role as a defining oncogenic abnormality in a subtype of AML.\n",
      "- ID 11879: The researchers analyzed immunophenotype in 30 cases of newly diagnosed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibiting M2 morphology per French-American-British classification. They correlated these findings with cytogenetic data. In 16 out of the 30 cases, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation or its variants were detected. The leukemias harboring t(8;21) did not significantly vary from other M2 cases regarding expression of various cell surface markers like CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD36, CD41a, CD42b, CDw65, TdT, or HLA-DR. However, the B-cell antigen CD19 expression was observed in 81% of t(8;21) cases compared to only 7% of non-t(8;21) M2 cases. Moreover, 63% of t(8;21) cases exhibited the NK-cell antigen CD56 expression versus 14% of non-t(8;21) M2 leukemias. Coexpression of CD19 and CD56 was exclusively found in the t(8;21) group. This coexpression pattern was absent in 48 cases of other AML subtypes lacking t(8;21). Additionally, non-t(8;21) M2 cases frequently expressed CD2 or CD7, while none of the t(8;21) cases did. The authors deduced that t(8;21) defines a biologically unique pediatric M2 AML subgroup with distinct immunophenotypic features differentiating it from other de novo AML types.\n",

The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.\n",

      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",

Metastatic lesions were found in the lung and spine. Pan-TRK immunostain was positive and RNA NGS detected a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion. The authors state this is the first report of a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion in a sarcoma, which seems to forecast high-grade morphology and behavior.\n",
      "- ID 10896: From a retrospective review of 38,095 tumor samples from 33,997 patients that underwent fusion screening at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 87 tumors were found to be positive for an NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusion. One positive patient with Glioblastoma Multiforme had an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 (e11::e14) fusion that was not detected by MSK-IMPACT, but was found with the RNA Archer screen. Detection of this fusion was positive in the cytoplasm by Pan-Trk immunohistochemical staining.\n",

A custom NGS panel identified a novel KANK1-NTRK2 fusion in both the classic and anaplastic regions. The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.\n",
      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",

The BCOR ITD was confirmed  on tumor DNA.  All samples showed numerous deleterious SNVs and InDels, but none were common among all samples.  BCOR ITD was the only common, recurrent alteration.\n",
      "- ID 10801: BCOR internal tandem duplications (ITDs) were found frequently in cases of clear cell sarcoma of kidney (CCSK), a rare pediatric renal cancer. The study initially evaluated 3 CCSK samples by whole exome sequencing and whole transcriptome sequencing. All 3 samples demonstrated BCOR ITD by RNA sequencing. This was further validated by targeted DNA sequencing of a validation institutional cohort of 11 primary and 2 matched metastatic CCSK cases, and an additional external cohort of 13 CCSK samples. Overall, BCOR ITDs were found in 85% (23/27 cases). No BCOR ITDs were found in neither matched normal kidney/blood, nor other childhood renal cancers. Upregulation of mutant BCOR transcripts and protein expression by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry was shown.\n",
      "- ID 10802: 27 cases of CCSK were profiled by whole exome sequencing and whole transcriptomics, identifying BCOR ITDs in the majority (23/27, 85%). BCOR  encodes a key constituent of a variant polycomb repressive complex (PRC). Similar to BCOR::CCNB3-related tumors, transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of PRC2-associated target genes including those associated with H3 K28 trimethylation. Disruption of polycomb repressive complex signaling likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of CCSK.\n",
      "- ID 11423: High BCOR expression which was associated with an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of 89 to 144 bp in exon 16 of the BCOR gene was identified in 20 of 20 (100%) of cases of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, but not in any of  the other 193 pediatric renal tumors tested.  This suggested that BCOR ITD may be useful in the diagnosis of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.\n",

Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable. The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day). After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts. The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).\n",

RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 8917: All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",
      "- ID 8931: The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 6099: Four out of six patients with infantile fibrosarcoma and a ETV6-NTRK3 fusion had a partial response, the remaining two had a complete response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",
      "- ID 11880: This study evaluated the independent prognostic significance of pretreatment cytogenetics based on the large Medical Research Council (MRC) AML 10 trial which enrolled a total of 1,966 patients (364 children and 1,602 adults). All patients diagnosed with de novo AML (337 children and 1,460 adults) or secondary AML (22 children and 119 adults) received comparable therapy. The study concluded that patients with different cytogenetic abnormalities can be divided into 3 prognostic subgroups with favorable, intermediate, and adverse outcomes solely based on the results of cytogenetics. AML with t(8;21) [which results in RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion] was grouped together with AML with inv(16) [CBFB::MYH11 fusion] and t(15;17) [PML::RARA fusion] in the favorable group. The 122 patients with AML with t(8;21) had a 98% CR (complete remission) rate and 2% induction deaths. The observed prognostic associations further support that these abnormalities define clinically and biologically distinct AML subtypes.\n",
      "- ID 11882: The authors of this 1997 paper compared morphologic and cytochemical features between 30 acute myeloid leukemia subtype M2 (AML-M2) patients with t(8;21)  and  50 AML-M2 patients without t(8;21). Morphologic characteristics highly enriched in cases positive for t(8;21) included irregular nuclear shape, Auer bodies, at least 90% myeloperoxidase positivity in blast cells, pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly of the nuclei, and homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils. These features were observed in 90-100% of the t(8;21) positive cases and were rare in the t(8;21) negative group. Homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils was the most characteristic of t(8;21)positive AML-M2, while pale-colored cytoplasm without any granules in mature neutrophils or dyserythropoietic features was never observed in association with t(8;21). The study suggests association of the t(8;21) with a subtype of AML that has morphologically recognizable features in a high proportion of cases.  Of note, AML with t(8;21) translocation is now known to result in a RUNX1::RUNX1T fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11878: In this 1992 study, the authors isolated a clone containing the junction region of the (8;21)(q22;q22) translocation characteristic for acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21). Using probes from the junction clone, the presence of this consistent junction region was confirmed in 9 independent cases of AML with t(8;21). The authors also isolated cDNA clones from a t(8;21) AML cDNA library that contained fused sequences from chromosomes 8 and 21. This allowed them to identify the chromosome 8 partner gene which they named ETO (currently known as RUNX1T1) and confirm the chromosome 21 partner as AML1 (currently RUNX1), which showed similarity with the Drosophila segmentation gene, runt. The consequence of the t(8;21) was determined to be the juxtaposition of 5' sequences of AML1 (RUNX1) to 3' sequences of ETO (RUNX1T1), oriented telomere to centromere on the der(8) chromosome. The study confirms that t(8;21) consistently results in an oncogenic fusion between specific partner genes, confirming its role as a defining oncogenic abnormality in a subtype of AML.\n",
      "- ID 11879: The researchers analyzed immunophenotype in 30 cases of newly diagnosed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibiting M2 morphology per French-American-British classification. They correlated these findings with cytogenetic data. In 16 out of the 30 cases, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation or its variants were detected. The leukemias harboring t(8;21) did not significantly vary from other M2 cases regarding expression of various cell surface markers like CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD36, CD41a, CD42b, CDw65, TdT, or HLA-DR. However, the B-cell antigen CD19 expression was observed in 81% of t(8;21) cases compared to only 7% of non-t(8;21) M2 cases. Moreover, 63% of t(8;21) cases exhibited the NK-cell antigen CD56 expression versus 14% of non-t(8;21) M2 leukemias. Coexpression of CD19 and CD56 was exclusively found in the t(8;21) group. This coexpression pattern was absent in 48 cases of other AML subtypes lacking t(8;21). Additionally, non-t(8;21) M2 cases frequently expressed CD2 or CD7, while none of the t(8;21) cases did. The authors deduced that t(8;21) defines a biologically unique pediatric M2 AML subgroup with distinct immunophenotypic features differentiating it from other de novo AML types.\n",

The above mutation was found in 1 kindred; 10 members were tested and 3 were found to harbour the mutation. The 7 members without a mutation were asymptomatic, while the 3 members with a mutation had manifestations. In addition to the 3 members who tested positive, there were 2 additional members who displayed manifestations, but died before testing could be performed. Clinical manifestations in this kindred included: renal cell carcinoma, CNS hemangioblastoma, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, and retinal hemangioblastoma. ACMG evidence codes: 'PP1' because of segregation results, 'PP4' because the patient's phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 5426: 43 unrelated VHL patients with previously sequenced VHL germline mutations and 36 suspected VHL mutation carriers were subject to denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) mutation screening. This mutation was found in 2  previously diagnosed VHL patients and a suspect VHL mutation carrier by DHPLC (family VHL 26, VHL 63, VHL 77). This variant results in an in frame deletion providing moderate evidence for pathogenicity (PM4).\n",
      "- ID 5203: In a study of 426 unrelated VHL patients, 111 were discovered to have alterations in the VHL gene. 18 novel variants were identified in VHL patients, but none were present in 200 unaffected control individuals. This deletion mutation was found in a 25 yr old VHL patient with multiple pancreatic cysts and hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system (index case 280). This study contains moderate support for pathogenicity because the protein length changes as a result changes as a result of in-frame deletions in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4).\n",
      "- ID 5766: Mutational analysis for 16 patients with clinically diagnosed VHL disease, revealed 12 germline mutations. This mutation was found in a 42-year-old VHL patient with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, renal cell carcinoma, and pancreatic cysts (proband no. 12). ACMG evidence codes: 'PP4' because the patient's phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 5750: This study reports 1,548 germline and somatic mutations from 945 VHL families. Mutation was detected in a VHL kindred with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, retinal hemangioblastomas and Grawitz tumor (also known as RCC) (case no. 2034). Protein length changes as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4). Patient's phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology (ACMG code: PP4).\n",
      "- ID 5340: Blood samples from 5 Japanese families revealed 4 germline mutations. This mutation was found in a family of 3 individuals (Family B). Only one patient in this family developed symtoms, which included a brain stem hemangioblastoma and retinal angioma discovered at age 30. Parents of this individual showed no manifestations of VHL disease and were negative for bands via single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis where the proband showed extra bands. This study contains moderate evidence of pathogenicity because the protein length changes as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4).\n",
      "- ID 6557: A prospective study followed 128 participants affected by VHL syndrome for 12 years in Padova, Italy. Individual patient data was not available, but frequency of specific mutations was presented. An in-frame deletion (TCT) at nucleotide 227 was present in 1 individual of the 122 total number of variants captured in this population.\n",
      "- ID 5386: A previous study of 26 Japanese, VHL families was extended to 41 additional families. Germline mutations were detected in 55 of 77 Japanese families. Renal cell carcinoma occurred predominantly in non-missense mutations predicted to lead to gross alteration or complete loss of the VHL protein. This mutation was found in a VHL type 1 patient with hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, pancreatic cyst or tumor, and renal cell carcinoma (family ID 80).\n",
      "- ID 6121: Molecular analysis of VHL gene in 146 probands, 103 with and 43 without a positive family history, resulted in the detection of 43 germline VHL mutations. Majority of mutations were found in patients with classic or multi-organ manifestations of VHL disease, but mutations were also found in patients with limited or single-organ manifestations of VHL disease. Follow-up of families with germline mutations and limited VHL manifestations was recommended. This in-frame deletion variant was detected in a VHL type 2 patient with cerebellar hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, and epididymal cysts (family no. 24).\n",
      "- ID 5744: Genotype-phenotype correlations of 573 VHL patients were analyzed and confirmed that higher risk of pheochromocytoma is associated with missense mutations that result in substitution of a surface amino acid or that disrupt the structural integrity of the VHL gene product (pVHL). Age-related risks of retinal angiomas and renal cell carcinoma were higher in patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations. This mutation was found in 4 unrelated families of 8 individuals total. 5 individuals had retinal hemangioblastomas, 4 had hemangioblastomas of the cerebellum, and 3 had renal cell carcinoma. ACMG evidence codes: 'PM4' because they observe a protein length change as a result of an in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region or stop-loss variants, 'PP4' because the patients' phenotypes or family history are highly specific for a disease with single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 5641: An investigation of 94 VHL patients without large deletions for intragenic mutations revealed 40 different mutations in 55 unrelated individuals. In all patients with multiple affected family members the missense mutation segregated with the disease. This mutation was found in 2 VHL type 1 patients (kindred no. 48, 75). Only moderate support for pathogenicity because protein length changes as a result of in-frame deletion in a nonrepeat region (ACMG code: PM4).\n",

      "- ID 6862: Medical records of 26 patients diagnosed with VHL disease in two Korean hospitals between 2003-2012 and harboring germline VHL mutations were retrospectively reviewed. One male patient diagnosed with Type 1 VHL disease at 23Y (Patient 14) presented with renal cell carcinoma, multiple CNS hemangioblastomas and other manifestations. He had a germline inframe deletion in the VHL gene (c.227delTCT) and a negative family history of VHL disease.\n",
      "- ID 11780: Histological, molecular, and clinical analysis of 26 histologically prototypical isomorphic diffuse gliomas with a specific DNA methylation profile distinct from other glial/glio-neuronal brain tumors and normal hemispheric tissue were found to be most closely related to pediatric MYB/MYBL1-altered diffuse astrocytomas and angiocentric gliomas. IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Nine tumors had MYBL1 rearrangements (including one involving 5’ of MYBL1) with various gene partners, including MMP16 (n=3), RAD51B (n=1), MAML2 (n=1), ZFHX4 (n=1), TOX (n=1), RP11-586K2.1 (intergenic region) (n=1), and RP11492M23.2 (intergenic region) (n=1). These fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain of MYBL1.  Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYBL1 in 10 tumors, including six with MYBL1 fusion and four without MYBL1 fusions detected. Increased MYBL1 expression was observed in 71% (10/14) of the tumors with MYBL1 alterations.\n",
      "- ID 11779: Comprehensive molecular studies (through whole genome, whole exome, transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide copy number analysis, clustering analysis by DNA methylation profiling, mutation hotspot analysis by Sanger sequencing, and FISH) were performed in a cohort of 91 low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs), including diffuse astrocytomas, angiocentric gliomas, gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas. Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and no IDH mutations were detected in these tumors. MYB (n=5) or MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangements were detected in 41% (7/17) of diffuse astrocytomas, while the remaining tumors had alternations involving BRAF (n = 4), FGFR1/3 (n = 4), and others (n = 2). The gene partners involving MYB fusions in diffuse astrocytomas included PCDHGA1, LOC154902, and MMP16, and the gene partners involving MYBL1 included MMP16. In contrast, a MYB fusion (most frequently MYB::QKI) characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (14 of 15). Only one other tumor across the series (an oligodendroglioma) had a MYB fusion (MYB::MAML2). MYB/MYBL-altered LGNTs clustered together with methylation profiling. The findings in LGNT with a predominantly astrocytic phenotype associating with MYB/MYBL alterations suggest a role of MYB/MYBL in these tumor categories with distinct characteristics.\n",
      "- ID 11781: Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2). All five DA2 samples with 8q focal gains exhibited a common centromeric breakpoint within MYBL1 after exon 9, resulting in partial duplication of MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged DA2 demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication with the telomeric sequence located in MMP16. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional DA2s with MYBL1 partial duplication. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas (AGs) in the related gene MYB on 6q23.3. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n",
      "- ID 9588: One patient was identified with a LMNA-NTRK1 positive tumor in this Phase I study (NCT02122913), which involved 70 heavily pretreated patients with a median age of 59.5 years, with multiple solid tumor types. A total of eight patients had NTRK fusions, and by independent radiology review, all patients with TRK fusion were considered to have had an objective response. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion. Authors concluded that NTRK fusions may represent tissue and age agnostic oncogenic drivers, and that Larotrectinib was well tolerated in the patients and demonstrated activity in all tumors with NTRK fusions.\n",
      "- ID 11576: A 31-year-old female presented with a pigmented nodule on her scalp that enlarged in size over a 2-year period. Biopsy demonstrated a fascicular proliferation of bland spindle cells within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and was found in adipose tissue in a “honeycomb pattern.” Immunohistochemical staining revealed the spindle cells were positive for CD34 and S-100 protein and were negative for SOX10. FISH was negative for PDGFB rearrangement. The spindle cells were positive for pan-NTRK by IHC and targeted RNA sequencing revealed the LMNA::NTRK1 e2::e10 fusion. The patient’s tumor was completely excised, and no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease was found at 24-month follow-up. The authors indicate the tumor analyses demonstrate a diagnosis of a NTRK-rearranged LPF-NT with unusual histopathological findings that include lymphoid aggregates and pigmented dendritic melanocytes.\n",
      "- ID 11577: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion. Biopsy revealed a spindle cell mesenchymal tumor with monotonous, bland spindle cells mixed with fat and blood vessels. IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Due to the unusual tumor location, an anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel was used and detected a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. The author’s reclassified their diagnosis to an S-100 positive LPF-NT of the spine based on the identification of the fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11578: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion.  IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel revealed a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) fusion that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. Surgical resection was not an option due to tumor size and location. The patient was enrolled into a phase II trial and treated with 600mg of entrectinib daily. After 1 month, the mass showed near-complete loss of enhancement and density (Hounsfield units dropped from 200 to 55-60). At week 12, response plateau was reached with the lesion reducing by 45% (RECIST 1.1). Due to the exceptional response, vertebrectomy was possible and completed. The patient continued entrectinib and has been recurrence free for 7 months.\n",
      "- ID 11650: A 3-year-old girl presented with spots on her right buttock that evolved into lumps. Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse subcutaneous tissue thickening without significant involvement of underlying soft tissue. Punch biopsy demonstrated small whorls and fascicles of bland spindled cells with no mitotic activity, atypical mitotic figures, or nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical staining resulted in CD34 positivity in the lesional cells, negative S100-protein in the spindle cells, and positive Pan-Trk staining in the spindled-cells. Transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) revealed the presence of an in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 fusion (exon4::exon10) that includes the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. According to the authors, this case presents grounds to use pan-Trk staining to determine the diagnosis of LPF versus LPF-NT S100 detection can vary in rare instances.\n",
      "- ID 11354: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, the entrectinib retained activity against both the wild type and the NTRK1 F589L gatekeeper mutation with IC50s of 0.30 +/- 0.1 and <0.2 nM respectively.\n",
      "- ID 11349: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, the first generation inhibitor larotrectinib was 28-150 fold less active against fusions with mutations in the NTRK1 kinase domain.  The IC50 for LMNA:NTRK1 with no mutation was 23.5 nM while the IC50s for the LMNA:NTRK1 fusion with G595R (solvent front), F589L (gatekeeper), or G667C (xDFG) mutation were 3540, 675, and 1630 nM respectively.\n",
      "- ID 11346: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, repotrectinib retained the greatest activity against fusions with mutations in the NTRK1 kinase domain.  The Ba/F3 proliferation IC50 for LMNA:NTRK1 with no mutation was <0.2 nM while the IC50s for the LMNA:NTRK1 fusion with G595R (solvent front), F589L (gatekeeper), G667C (xDFG), or G595R+F589L were 0.2, <0.2, 11.8, and 17.7 respectively. Repotrectinib also inhibited autophosphorylation of LMNA:NTRK1 in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the construct at low concentrations.\n",
      "- ID 10095: BaF3 cells were transduced with a number of NTRK fusions. IC50 values were measured following treatment with entrectinib: TPM3-NTRK1 (2.5nM), LMNA-NTRK1 (1.4nM), ETV6-NTRK1 (2.5nM), VCL-NTRK2 (4.3nM), AFAP1-NTRK2 (2.7nM), ETV6-NTRK2 (4.5nM), ETV6-NTRK3 (3.8nM), and control (>1000nM).\n",
      "- ID 8901: FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft of a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 10 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Expression was confirmed by Western and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. Western blot of the tumor also indicated constitutive activation of the fusion based on phosphorylation of the fusion. Additionally, downstream kinase targets (PLCγ1, AKT, and MAPK) were also phosphorylated in the tumor, similar to levels observed in the TPM3-NTRK1 containing KM12 colorectal cancer cell line.\n",
      "- ID 8900: After disease progression with no objective response to therapy, a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver displayed elevated NTRK1 expression in both primary tumor and liver metastasis as measured by immunohistochemistry. FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 11 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Fusion expression of both transcripts was confirmed by western blot, and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. After 4 weeks of treatment with Entrectinib, CT scan revealed the patient showed a partial response with a 30% reduction of target lesions. This response was maintained for 5 months.\n",
      "- ID 2955: LOXO-101 is an orally administered inhibitor of the TRK kinase and is highly selective only for the TRK family of receptors. The tumor of a 41-year-old woman with soft-tissue sarcoma metastatic to the lung was found to harbor an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 (exon 2 & exon 11) gene fusion encoding a functional LMNA-TRKA fusion oncoprotein. This patient's tumors underwent rapid and substantial tumor regression, with an accompanying improvement in pulmonary dyspnea, oxygen saturation, and plasma tumor markers.\n",
      "- ID 2960: A gene fusion between exon 11 of LMNA and exon 10 of NTRK1 was observed in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer after therapy with first-line FOLFOX, second-line FOLFIRI/cetuximab, and third-line irinotecan. The patient treated in a clinical trial with pan-TRK kinase inhibitor entrectinib. Treatment was well tolerated and led to a partial response (PR) with 30% tumor shrinkage of multiple liver metastases. Clinical response lasted 4 months.\n",
      "- ID 6100: One Patient with soft tissue sarcoma and a NTRK1-LMNA fusion had a partial response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",
      "- ID 6391: A 14-month-old boy presented with a slow-growing, asymptomatic back plaque, which was biopsied and found to have S100 positivity, sparse CD34 staining, and no significant mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism, or necrosis. IHC detected cytoplasmic expression of NTRK1 and FISH detected the LMNA::NTRK1 fusion. Based on these findings the authors conclude this is patient has a lipofibromatosis-like neural tumor (LPF-NT). The patient was treated with wide local excision and has developed no complications or evidence of recurrence with 6 months of follow-up time. LPF-NT is rare, with 14 cases previously reported, and this patient was the first report of this diagnosis in infancy.\n",
      "- ID 8878: A mass found at birth in a patient’s left arm became enlarged at age 2 and was resected and characterized as a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma. FISH and RT-PCR did not detect any common sarcoma translocations. A recurrence and a new mass formed after 4 months of therapy, so amputation was performed. Metastatic high-grade sarcoma appeared in the lungs 4 months later followed by multiple recurrences 10 months after treatment. Whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of diagnosis and normal samples were performed and the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact was discovered. Treatment with Crizotinib was started and a chest CT after 2 months revealed partial response. After 22 months of therapy, chest CT revealed a complete response of lung nodules, which has been sustained >18 months beyond the conclusion of treatment at 31 months.\n",
      "- ID 8902: A 40-year-old patient with a left calf mass revealed by biopsy to be a low grade myxoid spindle cell carcinoma underwent surgery and radiotherapy. Over a 5-year period, the patient experienced 3 lung metastases, which were all resected. At year 6, unresectable metastases were found in the lungs and lymph nodes. FISH and targeted next generation RNA sequencing of an earlier lung metastasis revealed and confirmed an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact. TRK inhibitor was administered and PET-CT scan revealed near complete response and no new lesions 1 year later.\n",
      "- ID 8903: The in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 11) with intact kinase domain was found and confirmed by next generation sequencing, RT-PCR, FISH, and/or immunohistochemistry in 3 Spitz neoplasm cases. Compared to controls (wildtype NTRK1 overexpression and GFP), lentiviral mediated overexpression of LMNA-NTRK1 in mouse melanocyte cells (melan-a) displayed increased phosphorylation of the fusion and downstream kinase targets, as assessed by Western Blot. Treatment with the NTRK1 inhibitor, AZ-23, quenched fusion and pathway activation. Additionally, injection of LMNA-NTRK1 melan-a cells into immunocompromised mice resulted in the rapid growth of tumors at the injection site within 40 days. Similar results were observed in mice injected with melan-a cells overexpressing NRAS G12V or HRAS G12V, but no tumors were observed in mice injected with GFP control melan-a cells.\n",
      "- ID 8904: A total of 140 Spitzoid neoplasm cases were analyzed by FISH and/or targeted DNA and RNA sequencing (n=38). Mutually exclusive kinase fusions were found in 72 cases. NTRK1 fusions were observed in 23 cases (8/75 Spitz naevi; 8/32 atypical Spitz tumors; 7/33 Spitzoid melanomas) and their expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. NTRK1 expression was absent in cases without a NTRK1 rearrangement. A 743kb deletion leading to the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 11) with the kinase domain intact was found in 3/38 NGS analyzed cases (1 nevus, 1 atypical, 1Spitzoid) and was verified by RT-PCR.\n",

This variant results in the deletion of phenylalanine at position 76, which is crucial for the stability and function of the VHL protein. Studies have shown that this deletion disrupts the protein's ability to regulate hypoxia-inducible factors, a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of Von Hippel-Lindau Disease.

      "- ID 11780: Histological, molecular, and clinical analysis of 26 histologically prototypical isomorphic diffuse gliomas with a specific DNA methylation profile distinct from other glial/glio-neuronal brain tumors and normal hemispheric tissue were found to be most closely related to pediatric MYB/MYBL1-altered diffuse astrocytomas and angiocentric gliomas. IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Nine tumors had MYBL1 rearrangements (including one involving 5’ of MYBL1) with various gene partners, including MMP16 (n=3), RAD51B (n=1), MAML2 (n=1), ZFHX4 (n=1), TOX (n=1), RP11-586K2.1 (intergenic region) (n=1), and RP11492M23.2 (intergenic region) (n=1). These fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain of MYBL1.  Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYBL1 in 10 tumors, including six with MYBL1 fusion and four without MYBL1 fusions detected. Increased MYBL1 expression was observed in 71% (10/14) of the tumors with MYBL1 alterations.\n",
      "- ID 11779: Comprehensive molecular studies (through whole genome, whole exome, transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide copy number analysis, clustering analysis by DNA methylation profiling, mutation hotspot analysis by Sanger sequencing, and FISH) were performed in a cohort of 91 low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs), including diffuse astrocytomas, angiocentric gliomas, gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas. Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and no IDH mutations were detected in these tumors. MYB (n=5) or MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangements were detected in 41% (7/17) of diffuse astrocytomas, while the remaining tumors had alternations involving BRAF (n = 4), FGFR1/3 (n = 4), and others (n = 2). The gene partners involving MYB fusions in diffuse astrocytomas included PCDHGA1, LOC154902, and MMP16, and the gene partners involving MYBL1 included MMP16. In contrast, a MYB fusion (most frequently MYB::QKI) characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (14 of 15). Only one other tumor across the series (an oligodendroglioma) had a MYB fusion (MYB::MAML2). MYB/MYBL-altered LGNTs clustered together with methylation profiling. The findings in LGNT with a predominantly astrocytic phenotype associating with MYB/MYBL alterations suggest a role of MYB/MYBL in these tumor categories with distinct characteristics.\n",
      "- ID 11781: Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2). All five DA2 samples with 8q focal gains exhibited a common centromeric breakpoint within MYBL1 after exon 9, resulting in partial duplication of MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged DA2 demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication with the telomeric sequence located in MMP16. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional DA2s with MYBL1 partial duplication. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas (AGs) in the related gene MYB on 6q23.3. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n",

HEY1 and NCOA2 are located on the same chromosome but generate distinct FISH signals, whereas the HEY1-NCOA2 fusion appears as a single fused dot. Specimens were considered positive for fusion when FISH showed overlapping signals of HEY1 and NCOA2 in greater than 20% of the cells. Overlap signal of over 20% was seen in 8/10 patients. The two patients with no overlap signal were also negative for FISH staining, suggesting insufficient or damaged material for FISH.\n",

      "- ID 11519: RNA-seq transcriptome analysis in a discovery cohort of 170 B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL)  cases negative for the common classifying cytogenetic aberrations identified several well-defined hierarchical expression clusters. Four clusters corresponded to known oncogenic subtypes, namely ZNF384, ERG/DUX4, BCR::ABL1-like, and KMT2A/MLL-rearranged. An additional cluster comprised 14 cases (8.2%), which lacked any fusion gene. Mutational analysis of RNA-seq data revealed the presence of a unique PAX5 mutation, c.239C>G, p.Pro80Arg (p.P80R), in all cases. In an additional cohort of 419 unselected BCP-ALL cases, PAX5 P80R was identified in 16 (5.3%). The authors conclude that the PAX5 P80R variant, with its distinct transcriptional signature, defines a subtype of BCP-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 7291: Integrated genomic analysis was performed for 1,988 childhood and adult B-ALL cases. Forty four cases (2.2%) showed the P80R substitution in the DNA binding domain for the PAX5 transcription factor gene. These cases were characterized by a unique expression profile. In the majority of the cases the mutation was hemizygous or homozygous, owing to deletion of the wild-type PAX5 allele or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. In 96% (42 of 44) of cases, the PAK5 P80R was accompanied by RAS and/or JAK-STAT signaling-pathway alterations (such as NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, NF1, IL7R), thereby suggesting cooperativity between deregulated PAX5 activity and kinase signaling.  The PAX5 P80R is proposed to define a distinct subtype of B-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 7290: In a large-scale international study RNA sequencing was performed to delineate the transcriptome landscape of 1,223 B-cell ALL cases. Twenty two cases were found to have P80R misense mutation in the DNA-binding domain of the PAX5 transcription factor gene. The P80R cases had unique expression profile and did not have any other known key driver mutations. The P80R is proposed to define a specific molecular/genetic subtype of B-ALL.   .\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\n",

All cases were confirmed by molecular testing to harbor YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions, 88% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 4 and 12% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 6. While conventional WWTR1::CAMTA1 EHE is characterized by relatively uniform morphology, YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma exhibits remarkable inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity with distinctive morphologic features not seen in conventional EHE. A striking clinical characteristic of YAP1::TFE3 fused hemangioendothelioma was that large proportion of patients survive many years with stable disease despite having multifocal disease and distant metastasis. The authors propose categorizing YAP1::TFE3 epithelioid hemangioendothelioma as a distinct disease entity from conventional epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (which typically harbors WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusions) due to its clinical and histopathologic characteristics.\n",

All 10 cases investigated by FISH showed TFE3 break-apart signal, and 8 of the 10 also showed YAP1 rearrangement.  A control group of similar tumor types which included 18 epithelioid hemangiomas, 9 pseudomyogenic HE, and 3 epithelioid angiosarcomas showed no TFE3 rearrangements suggesting the YAP1::TFE3 is specific for this subgroup of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.\n",

All cases were confirmed by molecular testing to harbor YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions, 88% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 4 and 12% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 6. The predicted fusion protein contains the TEAD binding site of YAP1 (located in exon 1), which is essential for tethering the protein to genes to activate transcription, and swaps the YAP1 transactivating domain for the basic helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains of TFE3. Thus the fusion protein acts as a transcription factor that utilizes the transactivating domains and nuclear localization sequences of TFE3 and binds DNA through the TEAD binding site on YAP1, resulting in a constitutively active chimeric transcription factor. YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) are highly homologous transcriptional co-regulators that are downstream nuclear effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway. In EHE with WWTR1::CAMTA1 gene fusion, WWTR1::CAMTA1 acts as a constitutively active form of TAZ. Thus the a YAP-like transcriptional program in YAP1::TFE3 fused EHE, is considered analogous to WWTR1::CAMTA1 EHE (PMID: 33913810).\n",

The group generated a cell line model system in which inducible expression of YWHAE::NUTM2 could be used to identify reliable immunohistochemical markers. The study concluded that reliance on a single marker in CCSK is not ideal and suggested BCOR, TLE1 and CCND1 could be useful as a group of markers, with the YWHAE::NUTM2 case as well as BCOR-ITD cases staining strongly for all three of these markers, while  63 control samples from tumor types often considered in the differential diagnosis were negative or weakly staining.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop. This inhibitory mechanism allows for kinase inhibition to occur in the face of D835 mutation.\n",
      "- ID 7283: In a phase 1/2 trial, patients with refractory or relapsed AML with FLT3 mutation (n=191; ITD n=162, D835 n=13, ITD-D835 n=16) received gilteritinib. 49% (93/191) of patients achieved an overall response, 9% (n=18) complete remission, 5% (n=10) complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery, 22% (n=42) complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery, and 12% (n=23) reached partial remission. The refractory or relapsed AML FLT wildtype group treated with gilteritinib(n=58) had lower overall response rate (12%), complete remission (2%), complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (0%), complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery (7%), and fewer reached partiral remission (3%). Also, bone marrow myeloblast reduction was greater in FLT3 mutant patients compared to FLT3 wildtype.\n",
      "- ID 8351: A 62-year-old female patient (AML5) was refractory to conventional chemotherapy and developed disease progression to quizartinib due to a D835I mutation. Using MTT to measure cytotoxicity, gilteritinib inhibited this patient’s relapse sample. Additionally, immunoblot demonstrated gilteritinib inhibited FLT3 phosphoryaltion at a concentration of 20 nM in the patient dereivd relapse cells.\n",
      "- ID 7728: In this phase 3 trial (ADMIRAL), 371 patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML (required to have FLT3 ITD or TKD D835 or I836 mutations) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either gilteritinib (n=247, at a dose of 120 mg per day) or salvage chemotherapy (n=124). Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy.\n",
      "- ID 8108: A 35 year-old male patient (AML4) presented with a FLT3-ITD mutation at diagnosis and was refractory to induction and salvage chemotherapy. He then received quizartinib and underwent allogenic transplant, but relapsed after 6 months. He then responded to sorafenib, but had disease progression with a FLT3-D835Y mutation. The patient derived relapse sample containing ITD and D835Y mutations was sensitive to gilteritinib based on cytotoxicity assays using MTT. Additionally, immunoblot demonstrated gilteritinib reduced FLT3 phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells expressing only D835Y with an IC50 of 1.4 nM.\n",
      "- ID 1282: In this Phase II trial of 87 patients (NCT01871805), alectinib was assayed for safety and efficacy in ALK positive NSCLC that had progressed on crizotinib. Of 69 patients with measurable disease, 35 achieved objective response, with median duration of response 13.5 months. Of 16 patients with measurable CNS disease, four achieved CNS complete response and 8 showed CNS partial response. median duration of CNS response was 11.1 months. 2 deaths were observed, and 1 was judged related to study treatment.\n",
      "- ID 7284: In a phase 3 trial, 303 patients with NSCLC with ALK fusion were randomly assigned to alectinib arm (N=152) or crizotinib arm (N=151). PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than with crizotinib (HR for disease progression or death 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.65, p<0.001). Investigator-assessed RR was 82.9% in alectinib arm and 75.5% in crizotinib arm. CNS RR in patients with measurable CNS lesions was 81% and 50% for alectinib and crizotinib, respectively. Eight patients in the alectinib group, in comparison to one patient with crizotinib, had a complete CNS response. Despite longer treatment duration for alectinib, there were fewer grade 3-5 adverse events compared with crizotinib treatment.\n",
      "- ID 1273: In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.\n",
      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",
      "- ID 1279: In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.\n",
      "- ID 8657: A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).\n",
      "- ID 11603: An analysis of 85 small blue round cell tumors (SBRCTs) that were negative for EWSR1, CIC, or BCOR by FISH identified 6 FUS::ERG and 1 FUS::FEV fusions.  Clinicopathologic characterization of these 7 cases with FUS fusions and 8 FUS-rearranged SBRCTs reported in the literature described the morphology as monomorphic round cell cytomorphology (keeping with a classic Ewing sarcoma phenotype) with diffuse membranous CD99 reactivity in all except one case with patchy staining.  Of note, there were 4 patients in this group who had scored negative for EWSR1 FISH that were positive for EWSR1::ERG  by other means (FusionSeq, RT-PCR, etc.) and the authors caution of the false negatives with EWSR1 FISH due to the complexity of the the EWSR1::ERG rearrangement.  The authors conclude that these rarer alternative fusions also lead to classic Ewing sarcoma.\n",
      "- ID 475: The t(21;22) rearrangement resulting in the EWSR1::ERG fusion is associated with the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma. EWSR1::ERG is the second most common gene fusion reported in this disease.\n",
      "- ID 10338: Molecular analysis of 30 Ewing tumors (designated as Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) in this 1994 paper) from patients with well-documented clinical course was performed.   RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28).  Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses.   The two tumors with EWSR1::ERG had breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG with a t(2;22) rearrangement detected in 1 of these 2 cases by karyotyping.  Authors conclude RT-PCR is a sensitive method for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors.\n",

      "- ID 11581: Six cases of CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor (HGNET) with BCOR exon 15 internal tandem duplication (ITD) were studied. The authors analyzed their clinical, pathologic and molecular characteristic and compared them with Clear Cell Sarcoma of Kidney (CCSK) and soft tissue sarcoma with the same genetic abnormality (BCOR ex15 ITD). Cases of CNS HGNET with BCOR ex15 ITD were histologically characterized by glial cell morphology, ependymoma-like perivascular pseudorosettes and palisading necrosis. Immunohistochemically, they showed diffuse staining of Olig2, and focal staining of GFAP, S-100 protein and synaptophysin. Clinically, histologically and immunohistochemically CNS  HG NETs with BCOR ex15 ITD were distinct from CCSK and soft tissue sarcomas with BCOR ex15 ITD, supporting that these should be considered a unique type of CNS tumor.\n",
      "- ID 10800: The authors generated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of 323 tumors with an institutional diagnosis of ‘primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-PNETs)’,  which  are highly aggressive, poorly differentiated embryonal tumors occurring predominantly in young children but also affecting adolescents and adults. Four novel methylation profiles were identified. One of those profiles was exhibited by 10/323 (3 %) cases,  and all these tumors were found to have a duplicated region in exon 15 of BCOR [BCOR internal tandem duplication (ITD)] by DNA/RNA sequencing, identical to that of the BCOR ITD in other tumor types including clear cell sarcomas of the kidney, undifferentiated round cell sarcomas in infants, and primitive myxoid mesenchymal tumour of infancy. The authors compared DNA methylation pattern of the BCOR-ITD positive cases with an in-house collection of > 10,000 methylation profiles from a broad variety of pediatric and adult CNS tumors. Additional tumors with variety of histologies showed the same methylation profile as BCOR-ITD positive cases, and were also found to have BCOR-ITD. The authors proposed that BCOR-ITD defines a specific molecular subtype of  CNS tumors.\n",
      "- ID 10887: 10 cases of high-grade neuroepithelial tumor  (HGNET) with BCOR exon 15 ITD were studied. In addition, 25 previously reported and published patients were included in survival analyses. These tumors are newly proposed to belong to a separate entity with a distinct methylation profile and a characteristic genetic alteration. The authors further describe  their clinical, pathologic, radiographic, and genetic features. Shared histologic characteristics included predominantly solid growth, glioma‐like fibrillarity, perivascular pseudorosettes, and palisading necrosis, but absence of microvascular proliferation. Immunohistochemistry testing showed absent GFAP expression, no synaptophysin expression, variable OLIG2 and NeuN positivity, and diffuse strong BCOR nuclear positivity. In 6 of 10 cases, BCOR ex15 ITD was the only pathogenic alteration seen, while other cases showed additional genetic abnormalities including CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, TERT amplification or promoter hotspot mutation, and damaging mutations in TP53, BCORL1, EP300, SMARCA2 and STAG2. The authors conclude that their findings further support inclusion of HG NET with BCOR ex15 ITD as a distinct CNS tumor entity.\n",
      "- ID 10804: 10/323 studied high-grade primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-HGPNETs)  clustered together based on their unique methylation profile. 10/10 of those tumors exhibited in-frame internal tandem duplications in the BCOR gene. The duplicated region was identical with that of the BCOR ITDs described in clear cell sarcoma of the kidney. 1 additional tumor harbored a BCOR intragenic in-frame deletion, and two additional tumors had BCOR frameshift mutations. Gene expression of BCOR was higher in CNS HG PNET BCOR-ITD positive tumors than in other CNS tumor types, suggesting different mechanism from BCOR loss-of-function mutations reported in other malignancies,. The results are consistent with BCOR-ITDs acting as primary oncogenic drivers in a unique type of CNS HG PNETs.\n",
      "- ID 11780: Histological, molecular, and clinical analysis of 26 histologically prototypical isomorphic diffuse gliomas with a specific DNA methylation profile distinct from other glial/glio-neuronal brain tumors and normal hemispheric tissue were found to be most closely related to pediatric MYB/MYBL1-altered diffuse astrocytomas and angiocentric gliomas. IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Nine tumors had MYBL1 rearrangements (including one involving 5’ of MYBL1) with various gene partners, including MMP16 (n=3), RAD51B (n=1), MAML2 (n=1), ZFHX4 (n=1), TOX (n=1), RP11-586K2.1 (intergenic region) (n=1), and RP11492M23.2 (intergenic region) (n=1). These fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain of MYBL1.  Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYBL1 in 10 tumors, including six with MYBL1 fusion and four without MYBL1 fusions detected. Increased MYBL1 expression was observed in 71% (10/14) of the tumors with MYBL1 alterations.\n",
      "- ID 11779: Comprehensive molecular studies (through whole genome, whole exome, transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide copy number analysis, clustering analysis by DNA methylation profiling, mutation hotspot analysis by Sanger sequencing, and FISH) were performed in a cohort of 91 low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs), including diffuse astrocytomas, angiocentric gliomas, gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas. Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and no IDH mutations were detected in these tumors. MYB (n=5) or MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangements were detected in 41% (7/17) of diffuse astrocytomas, while the remaining tumors had alternations involving BRAF (n = 4), FGFR1/3 (n = 4), and others (n = 2). The gene partners involving MYB fusions in diffuse astrocytomas included PCDHGA1, LOC154902, and MMP16, and the gene partners involving MYBL1 included MMP16. In contrast, a MYB fusion (most frequently MYB::QKI) characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (14 of 15). Only one other tumor across the series (an oligodendroglioma) had a MYB fusion (MYB::MAML2). MYB/MYBL-altered LGNTs clustered together with methylation profiling. The findings in LGNT with a predominantly astrocytic phenotype associating with MYB/MYBL alterations suggest a role of MYB/MYBL in these tumor categories with distinct characteristics.\n",
      "- ID 11781: Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2). All five DA2 samples with 8q focal gains exhibited a common centromeric breakpoint within MYBL1 after exon 9, resulting in partial duplication of MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged DA2 demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication with the telomeric sequence located in MMP16. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional DA2s with MYBL1 partial duplication. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas (AGs) in the related gene MYB on 6q23.3. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n",
      "- ID 12060: In this 2014 study, the authors compared 10 primary sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas (SEF), 4 cases of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), and one primary hybrid SEF/LGFMS. Patients with LGFMS ranged from 22 to 53 years of age.  All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement.  EWSR1::CREB3L1 was detected in SEF.  The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF while FUS::CREB3L2 is common in LGFMS, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.\n",
      "- ID 12062: In this study, an RT-PCR assay detected a FUS::CREB3L2 transcript in 14 of 16 (88%) low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) cases, whereas the fusion was not detected in any of the 123 other soft-tissue tumors (including desmoid-type fibromatoses, myxofibrosarcomas, soft-tissue perineuriomas, and congenital or adult fibrosarcomas). Patients ages ranged from 13 to 58 years. The fusion product involved exon 6 of FUS and exon 5 of CREB3L2 in the majority of cases. This supports FUS::CREB3L2 detection as a reliable approach to accurately diagnose LGFMS.\n",
      "- ID 12061: RT-PCR analysis of 59 low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas (LGFMS) and 52 non-LGFMS tumors selected for their resemblance to LGFMS (LGFMS-like tumors), identified a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion in 45 cases, a FUS::CREB3L1 in 3 cases, and no fusion in 11 cases of LGFMS. FUS exon 6 and CREB3L2 exon 5 were most frequently rearranged. Median age at LGFMS diagnosis was 35 years (range 11 to 75 years). 7 of 52 non-LGMFS neoplasms contained a FUS-CREB3L2 fusion with 4 of these diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, a sarcoma known to have molecular and morphological overlap with LGMFS.  The presence of these FUS fusions and the histology may be helpful in diagnosis.\n",

      "- ID 10337: Molecular analysis of 30 Ewing tumors (designated as Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) in this 1994 paper) from patients with well-documented clinical course was performed.   RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28).  Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses.  19 of 28 (67%) were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex6 (type I), 4 of 28  (14%)  were EWSR1 ex7::FLI1 ex5 (type II) and there was 1 each of EWSR1 ex7:: FLI1 ex7, EWSR1 ex 10::FLI1 ex 5, and EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4.  This last tumor (EWSR1 ex 9::FLI1 ex4) had evidence of an additional 4 splicing variants corresponding to EWSR1 exon 7 to FLI1 exons 4, 6, 8 and 9.  Two tumors had EWSR1::ERG with breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG.  Of note, karyotyping only revealed a chromosome 22 rearrangement in 18 out of 27 cases tested (67%), however this was thought to be due to failure to obtain mitotic figures (5 of 9) and insufficient  material (4 of 9).  Authors conclude RT-PCR is better than karyotyping for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors. In this small study, EWSR::FLI1 type I fusion predominated over type II in localized Ewing's and were more abundant in tumors affecting the long bones (9 versus 0), however no correlations between different EWSR1 transcripts and any other clinical parameters could be identified.\n",

      "- ID 11773: The study compiled clinicopathologic and molecular features of 46 gliomas with a MYB or MYBL1 alteration diagnosed at a single center. The tumors showed low-grade histopathologic features and were broadly classified as diffuse astrocytoma (n = 11) or angiocentric glioma (n=35). Molecular alterations interrogated by immunohistochemistry (n=46), RNA sequencing (n=29), FISH (n=24), or PCR-based sequencing (n=11) revealed MYB (n=44) or MYBL1 (n=2) alterations in all tumors. MYB and MYBL1 were fused with various gene partners. None had alterations in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, ATRX, or histone H3 genes. Regardless of histopathologic diagnosis or anatomic location, DNA methylome profiling on 35 MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas formed a single cluster, supporting that MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas represent a single disease entity with a range of clinical and pathologic characteristics. Only MYB rearrangements were detected in angiocentric gliomas. Of the 35 angiocentric gliomas, 22 had identified gene partners, primarily QKI (n=19), PCDHGA1 (n=1), LOC105378099 (n=1) and ESR1 (n=1).\n",
      "- ID 11774: Copy-number analysis was performed on 44 diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) to identify recurrent alterations. The most significant event, focal 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% (5/18) of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs (DA2), resulting in partial duplication of the transcription factor MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint between exons 10 and 11 of MYB on 6q23.3 was identified in two of four angiocentric gliomas (AGs). This study did not mention the partner genes involved in the MYB rearrangements in the two AGs. The results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n",
      "- ID 11775: A research study performed in 2010 involved 57 pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and a comparison group of 59 pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Among the LGG group, there were 34 cases of pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) and 23 cases of diffuse gliomas, which included fibrillary astrocytomas (DAs, n=14), oligodendroglial tumors (n=7), and angiocentric gliomas (AGs, n=2). The study utilized SNP arrays and FISH to detect MYB rearrangements, and quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IMHC) to analyze MYB expression levels. Results revealed increased MYB expression in both AGs, with one AG showing a focal deletion in the 3' terminal region of MYB. Overall, increased MYB expression by RT-PCR was seen in 8 LGGs, including 5 DAs, 2 AGs, and 1 oligodendroglioma, and all three cases with MYB copy number aberrations. IMHC revealed an increase in MYB expression at the protein level in 60% of LGGs) including 41% of PAs, and 19% of HGGs. Notably, genomic abnormalities were exclusively observed in diffuse gliomas.The findings suggest that MYB dysregulation may contribute to pediatric gliomas through various mechanisms beyond amplification and deletion.\n",
      "- ID 11769: Comprehensive molecular studies through whole genome, whole exome, transcriptome sequencing, genome-wide copy number analysis, clustering analysis by DNA methylation profiling, as well as mutation hotspot analysis by Sanger sequencing and FISH were performed in a cohort of 91 low-grade neuroepithelial tumors (LGNTs) in 2016. Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and the dominant lesions were MYB fusions (21/32; 66%). A MYB::QKI fusion characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (13/15; 87%) with the reamining two tumors harborting a MYB::ESR1 fusion (1/15) or QKI rearrangement (1/15). The last case with QKI rearrangement had no apparent involvement of MYB or MYBL1, only showing split signals using FISH break-apart probes across QKI. However, the study did not have sufficient derivatives from this tumor for FFPE RNA-seq, so it was unable to determine whether a cryptic MYB::QKI aberration was present in this case, or whether QKI was fused to another gene partner. Most MYB::QKI fusions (78%) were between MYB exon 15 and QKI exon 5. Fusions were also identified between MYB exon 9 and QKI exon 5. These fusions removed the 3'UTR regulatory site or the entire inhibitory C-terminal domain of MYB, leading to its overexpression. Two tumors with a MYB::QKI fusion also harbored a BRAF p.V600E mutation.\n",
      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",
      "- ID 10362: In a further investigation of non-traditional sarcoma cases, a 41-year-old man was thought to have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in the neck and spinal cord, but large rhabdoid/epithelioid cell morphology and retained H3K27Me3. Metastatic lesions were found in the lung and spine. Pan-TRK immunostain was positive and RNA NGS detected a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion. The authors state this is the first report of a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion in a sarcoma, which seems to forecast high-grade morphology and behavior.\n",
      "- ID 10896: From a retrospective review of 38,095 tumor samples from 33,997 patients that underwent fusion screening at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 87 tumors were found to be positive for an NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusion. One positive patient with Glioblastoma Multiforme had an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 (e11::e14) fusion that was not detected by MSK-IMPACT, but was found with the RNA Archer screen. Detection of this fusion was positive in the cytoplasm by Pan-Trk immunohistochemical staining.\n",
      "- ID 8653: A case report showing a two-year-old girl with an unusual pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) with both classic- and anaplastic- appearing tumors. A custom NGS panel identified a novel KANK1-NTRK2 fusion in both the classic and anaplastic regions. The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.\n",
      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.\n",

Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy.\n",

The refractory or relapsed AML FLT wildtype group treated with gilteritinib(n=58) had lower overall response rate (12%), complete remission (2%), complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (0%), complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery (7%), and fewer reached partiral remission (3%). Also, bone marrow myeloblast reduction was greater in FLT3 mutant patients compared to FLT3 wildtype.\n",
      "- ID 8923: This study was designed to test the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in vitro against FLT3-ITD and other TKD variants clinically observed. IC50s were determined from immunoblots quantifying FLT3 phosphorylation in endogenous (Molm14) or ectopic expression FLT3-ITD cell lines (TF-1, Ba/F3) and the endogenous wildtype FLT3 SEMK2 cell line after gilteritinib treatment. IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib.

Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15.

The age range for the RCC cases was 5 to 73 years. Fusion partners of TFE3 were identified using FISH (with confirmation by RNA sequencing in 5 cases) for 41/47 RCC cases, and included 7 SFPQ::TFE3 (PSF), 16 PRCC::TFE3, 12 ASPSCR1::TFE3 (ASPL), 5 NONO::TFE3, and 1 DVL2::TFE3. For the remaining 6 cases, the fusion partner of TFE3 was unable to be determined.

The patients ranged from 17 months to 17 years of age. RT-PCR performed on the extracted RNA identified the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion product in all eight cases. Seven of the cases contained the type 1 product, a fusion of ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 4, whereas one cases showed a type 2 product, a fusion of ASPSCR1 to TFE3 exon 3.   These cases were initially diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) but upon further analysis were recognized to contain similarities to ASPS, likely due to the ASPSCR1::TFE3 fusion suggesting they are a distinctive subset of RCC.

      "- ID 11526: A 4 year old African American girl was seen for a lesion on the scalp. Punch biopsy was done on a largely skin-colored subcutaneous nodule. Subcutaneous nodular aggregations of heavily pigmented epithelioid melanocytes were seen, with melanophages and a small amount of lymphocytes. Proliferation index (Ki-67) was less than 5%. The child was diagnosed with Pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (PEM), which usually occurs spontaneously as solitary neoplasms in otherwise healthy patients, and rarely spreads beyond the lymph node basin. Comparative genomic hybridization array showed gains and losses at 15q and losses at 17q. The authors note that melanoma often shows three or more segmental amplifications or deletions in reproducible loci, but the alterations in this patient were not commonly seen. A breakpoint was seen in the amplified regions involving the NTRK3 gene with an amplification of 5' end and loss of 3' end and this indicated a possible fusion. Next generation sequencing confirmed the presence of NTRK3 amplification at the 5' end and loss at the 3' end. In addition, an in-frame fusion with NTRK3 at the 5' end was found involving NTRK3 exons 1 to 7 and SCAPER exons 13 to 31 as the 3' partner. This fusion did not include NTRK3 kinase domain (exons 13-18). The tumor was excised with narrow margins and follow up showed no evidence for underlying Carney complex.\n",

However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.\n",

      "- ID 1421: In this Phase III trial (coBRIM, NCT01689519) of 495 V600 mutant melanoma patients, 344 had V600E mutation. 174 patients were treated with vemurafenib and placebo, and 170 were treated with vemurafenib and cobimetinib and tested for progression free survival. 88 of 174 monotherapy group patients had an event with median progression free survival of 6.5 months. In the combination group 58 of 174 patients had an event with median progression-free survival not met, however, when in combination with other V600 mutations median progression-free survival was 9.9 months with combination treatment. Median time to followup for the whole cohort was 7.3 months. Hazard Ratio for progression or death was 0.57 (0.41-0.80).\n",
      "- ID 6044: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, adult patients with histologically confirmed BRAF(V600) mutation-positive unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive cobimetinib or placebo, in combination with oral vemurafenib. Progression-free survival was the primary endpoint. Between Jan 8, 2013, and Jan 31, 2014, 495 eligible adult patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the cobimetinib plus vemurafenib group (n=247) or placebo plus vemurafenib group (n=248). Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival was 12.3 months for cobimetinib and vemurafenib versus 7.2 months for placebo and vemurafenib (HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.46-0.72], p<0.0001). Median overall survival was 22.3 months for cobimetinib and vemurafenib versus 17.4 months for placebo and vemurafenib (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.90; p=0.005). The safety profile for cobimetinib and vemurafenib was tolerable and manageable, and no new safety signals were observed with longer follow-up.\n",
      "- ID 6966: In this Phase 1b study, 129 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma were verified for BRAF V600 mutation using the cobas 4800 mutation test were selected who had progressed on vemurafenib (66 patients) or never received BRAF inhibitor (63 patients). The combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib was deemed safe and tolerable. Confirmed objective responses were seen in 15% of vemurafenib progressed patients and median progression-free survival was 2.8 months (95% CI 2·6–3·4). Confirmed objective responses were seen in 87% of patients who had never received BRAF inhibitor, including 10% with complete response. Median progression-free survival was 13.7 months (95% CI 10·1–17·5). The majority of patients had BRAF V600E mutation. Post-hoc sequencing of 94 tumor samples indicated seven tumors with a mutation other than BRAF V600E.\n",
      "- ID 11424: Whole transcriptome sequencing on tumors from 8 patients with clear cell sarcoma of the kidney identified BCOR ITD and overexpression of BCOR in all samples.  The BCOR ITD was confirmed  on tumor DNA.  All samples showed numerous deleterious SNVs and InDels, but none were common among all samples.  BCOR ITD was the only common, recurrent alteration.\n",
      "- ID 10801: BCOR internal tandem duplications (ITDs) were found frequently in cases of clear cell sarcoma of kidney (CCSK), a rare pediatric renal cancer. The study initially evaluated 3 CCSK samples by whole exome sequencing and whole transcriptome sequencing. All 3 samples demonstrated BCOR ITD by RNA sequencing. This was further validated by targeted DNA sequencing of a validation institutional cohort of 11 primary and 2 matched metastatic CCSK cases, and an additional external cohort of 13 CCSK samples. Overall, BCOR ITDs were found in 85% (23/27 cases). No BCOR ITDs were found in neither matched normal kidney/blood, nor other childhood renal cancers. Upregulation of mutant BCOR transcripts and protein expression by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry was shown.\n",
      "- ID 10802: 27 cases of CCSK were profiled by whole exome sequencing and whole transcriptomics, identifying BCOR ITDs in the majority (23/27, 85%). BCOR  encodes a key constituent of a variant polycomb repressive complex (PRC). Similar to BCOR::CCNB3-related tumors, transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of PRC2-associated target genes including those associated with H3 K28 trimethylation. Disruption of polycomb repressive complex signaling likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of CCSK.\n",
      "- ID 11423: High BCOR expression which was associated with an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of 89 to 144 bp in exon 16 of the BCOR gene was identified in 20 of 20 (100%) of cases of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, but not in any of  the other 193 pediatric renal tumors tested.  This suggested that BCOR ITD may be useful in the diagnosis of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.\n",
      "- ID 10840: A 23 month old (at the time of report) male was diagnosed prenatally with Stage II cellular mesoblastic nephroma (MN) on the right kidney, which was surgically removed on the sixth day of life. ETV6::NTRK was found by FISH. At 12 months a lesion on the distal tibia developed. The patient entered the larotrectinib pediatric study NCT02637687 and received eight cycles of therapy without any grade 2 or greater toxicities so far.   After this the patient had a full range of motion in the lower extremity and the there was a complete disappearance of the soft-tissue component and a near-complete reconstitution of the cortex of the distal right tibial metastatic focus.\n",
      "- ID 10841: A frequent genetic alteration in congenital mesoblastic nephroma is the translocation t(12;15) resulting in a fusion of the ETV6 gene on 12p13 and the NTRK3 gene on 15p15 that occurs almost exclusively in cellular mesoblastic nephroma subtype.  In a group of 111 mesoblastic nephroma (MN) samples, 79 were were evaluable by FISH, which consisted of 38 classical MN, 29 cellular MN, and 12 mixed MN samples. 16 of 29 cellular type MN had ETV6::NTRK3 via break apart FISH, while 0/38 classical and 0/12 mixed types were positive.\n",

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",

Of 69 patients with measurable disease, 35 achieved objective response, with median duration of response 13.5 months. Of 16 patients with measurable CNS disease, four achieved CNS complete response and 8 showed CNS partial response. median duration of CNS response was 11.1 months. 2 deaths were observed, and 1 was judged related to study treatment.\n",
      "- ID 7284: In a phase 3 trial, 303 patients with NSCLC with ALK fusion were randomly assigned to alectinib arm (N=152) or crizotinib arm (N=151). PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than with crizotinib (HR for disease progression or death 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.65, p<0.001). Investigator-assessed RR was 82.9% in alectinib arm and 75.5% in crizotinib arm. CNS RR in patients with measurable CNS lesions was 81% and 50% for alectinib and crizotinib, respectively. Eight patients in the alectinib group, in comparison to one patient with crizotinib, had a complete CNS response. Despite longer treatment duration for alectinib, there were fewer grade 3-5 adverse events compared with crizotinib treatment.\n",
      "- ID 1273: In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.\n",
      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",
      "- ID 1279: In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.\n",

When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).\n",
      "- ID 11578: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion.  IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel revealed a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) fusion that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. Surgical resection was not an option due to tumor size and location. The patient was enrolled into a phase II trial and treated with 600mg of entrectinib daily. After 1 month, the mass showed near-complete loss of enhancement and density (Hounsfield units dropped from 200 to 55-60). At week 12, response plateau was reached with the lesion reducing by 45% (RECIST 1.1). Due to the exceptional response, vertebrectomy was possible and completed. The patient continued entrectinib and has been recurrence free for 7 months.\n",

      "- ID 8900: After disease progression with no objective response to therapy, a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver displayed elevated NTRK1 expression in both primary tumor and liver metastasis as measured by immunohistochemistry. FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 11 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Fusion expression of both transcripts was confirmed by western blot, and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. After 4 weeks of treatment with Entrectinib, CT scan revealed the patient showed a partial response with a 30% reduction of target lesions. This response was maintained for 5 months.\n",
      "- ID 2960: A gene fusion between exon 11 of LMNA and exon 10 of NTRK1 was observed in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer after therapy with first-line FOLFOX, second-line FOLFIRI/cetuximab, and third-line irinotecan. The patient treated in a clinical trial with pan-TRK kinase inhibitor entrectinib.

      "- Molecular Profile Summary: BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.\n",

A total of 106 primary liver tumors were studied by RT-PCR (26 fibrolamellar carcinomas, 25 conventional hepatocellular carcinomas, 25 cholangiocarcinomas, 25 hepatic adenomas, and 5 hepatoblastomas). FISH was tested in 19 fibrolamellar carcinomas and in 6 scirrhous hepatocellular carcinomas. Evidence of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion was found in all fibrolamellar cases but not in other tumor types for both methods indicating that detection of DNAJB1-PRKACA is a very sensitive and specific finding in support of the diagnosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma.\n",

Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood.

Four clusters corresponded to known oncogenic subtypes, namely ZNF384, ERG/DUX4, BCR::ABL1-like, and KMT2A/MLL-rearranged. An additional cluster comprised 14 cases (8.2%), which lacked any fusion gene. Mutational analysis of RNA-seq data revealed the presence of a unique PAX5 mutation, c.239C>G, p.Pro80Arg (p.P80R), in all cases. In an additional cohort of 419 unselected BCP-ALL cases, PAX5 P80R was identified in 16 (5.3%). The authors conclude that the PAX5 P80R variant, with its distinct transcriptional signature, defines a subtype of BCP-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 7291: Integrated genomic analysis was performed for 1,988 childhood and adult B-ALL cases. Forty four cases (2.2%) showed the P80R substitution in the DNA binding domain for the PAX5 transcription factor gene. These cases were characterized by a unique expression profile. In the majority of the cases the mutation was hemizygous or homozygous, owing to deletion of the wild-type PAX5 allele or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. In 96% (42 of 44) of cases, the PAK5 P80R was accompanied by RAS and/or JAK-STAT signaling-pathway alterations (such as NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, NF1, IL7R), thereby suggesting cooperativity between deregulated PAX5 activity and kinase signaling.  The PAX5 P80R is proposed to define a distinct subtype of B-ALL.\n",

Twenty two cases were found to have P80R misense mutation in the DNA-binding domain of the PAX5 transcription factor gene. The P80R cases had unique expression profile and did not have any other known key driver mutations. The P80R is proposed to define a specific molecular/genetic subtype of B-ALL.   .\n",

A total of eight patients had NTRK fusions, and by independent radiology review, all patients with TRK fusion were considered to have had an objective response. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion. Authors concluded that NTRK fusions may represent tissue and age agnostic oncogenic drivers, and that Larotrectinib was well tolerated in the patients and demonstrated activity in all tumors with NTRK fusions.\n",
      "- ID 11576: A 31-year-old female presented with a pigmented nodule on her scalp that enlarged in size over a 2-year period. Biopsy demonstrated a fascicular proliferation of bland spindle cells within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and was found in adipose tissue in a “honeycomb pattern.” Immunohistochemical staining revealed the spindle cells were positive for CD34 and S-100 protein and were negative for SOX10. FISH was negative for PDGFB rearrangement. The spindle cells were positive for pan-NTRK by IHC and targeted RNA sequencing revealed the LMNA::NTRK1 e2::e10 fusion. The patient’s tumor was completely excised, and no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease was found at 24-month follow-up. The authors indicate the tumor analyses demonstrate a diagnosis of a NTRK-rearranged LPF-NT with unusual histopathological findings that include lymphoid aggregates and pigmented dendritic melanocytes.\n",
      "- ID 11577: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion. Biopsy revealed a spindle cell mesenchymal tumor with monotonous, bland spindle cells mixed with fat and blood vessels. IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Due to the unusual tumor location, an anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel was used and detected a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. The author’s reclassified their diagnosis to an S-100 positive LPF-NT of the spine based on the identification of the fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11578: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion.  IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel revealed a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) fusion that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. Surgical resection was not an option due to tumor size and location. The patient was enrolled into a phase II trial and treated with 600mg of entrectinib daily. After 1 month, the mass showed near-complete loss of enhancement and density (Hounsfield units dropped from 200 to 55-60). At week 12, response plateau was reached with the lesion reducing by 45% (RECIST 1.1). Due to the exceptional response, vertebrectomy was possible and completed. The patient continued entrectinib and has been recurrence free for 7 months.\n",
      "- ID 11650: A 3-year-old girl presented with spots on her right buttock that evolved into lumps. Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse subcutaneous tissue thickening without significant involvement of underlying soft tissue. Punch biopsy demonstrated small whorls and fascicles of bland spindled cells with no mitotic activity, atypical mitotic figures, or nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical staining resulted in CD34 positivity in the lesional cells, negative S100-protein in the spindle cells, and positive Pan-Trk staining in the spindled-cells. Transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) revealed the presence of an in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 fusion (exon4::exon10) that includes the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. According to the authors, this case presents grounds to use pan-Trk staining to determine the diagnosis of LPF versus LPF-NT S100 detection can vary in rare instances.\n",

      "- ID 8901: FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft of a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 10 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Expression was confirmed by Western and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. Western blot of the tumor also indicated constitutive activation of the fusion based on phosphorylation of the fusion. Additionally, downstream kinase targets (PLCγ1, AKT, and MAPK) were also phosphorylated in the tumor, similar to levels observed in the TPM3-NTRK1 containing KM12 colorectal cancer cell line.\n",
      "- ID 8900: After disease progression with no objective response to therapy, a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver displayed elevated NTRK1 expression in both primary tumor and liver metastasis as measured by immunohistochemistry. FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 11 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Fusion expression of both transcripts was confirmed by western blot, and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact.

The patient treated in a clinical trial with pan-TRK kinase inhibitor entrectinib. Treatment was well tolerated and led to a partial response (PR) with 30% tumor shrinkage of multiple liver metastases. Clinical response lasted 4 months.\n",
      "- ID 6100: One Patient with soft tissue sarcoma and a NTRK1-LMNA fusion had a partial response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",
      "- ID 6391: A 14-month-old boy presented with a slow-growing, asymptomatic back plaque, which was biopsied and found to have S100 positivity, sparse CD34 staining, and no significant mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism, or necrosis. IHC detected cytoplasmic expression of NTRK1 and FISH detected the LMNA::NTRK1 fusion. Based on these findings the authors conclude this is patient has a lipofibromatosis-like neural tumor (LPF-NT). The patient was treated with wide local excision and has developed no complications or evidence of recurrence with 6 months of follow-up time. LPF-NT is rare, with 14 cases previously reported, and this patient was the first report of this diagnosis in infancy.\n",
      "- ID 8878: A mass found at birth in a patient’s left arm became enlarged at age 2 and was resected and characterized as a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma. FISH and RT-PCR did not detect any common sarcoma translocations. A recurrence and a new mass formed after 4 months of therapy, so amputation was performed. Metastatic high-grade sarcoma appeared in the lungs 4 months later followed by multiple recurrences 10 months after treatment. Whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of diagnosis and normal samples were performed and the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact was discovered. Treatment with Crizotinib was started and a chest CT after 2 months revealed partial response. After 22 months of therapy, chest CT revealed a complete response of lung nodules, which has been sustained >18 months beyond the conclusion of treatment at 31 months.\n",
      "- ID 8902: A 40-year-old patient with a left calf mass revealed by biopsy to be a low grade myxoid spindle cell carcinoma underwent surgery and radiotherapy. Over a 5-year period, the patient experienced 3 lung metastases, which were all resected. At year 6, unresectable metastases were found in the lungs and lymph nodes. FISH and targeted next generation RNA sequencing of an earlier lung metastasis revealed and confirmed an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact. TRK inhibitor was administered and PET-CT scan revealed near complete response and no new lesions 1 year later.\n",
      "- ID 8903: The in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 11) with intact kinase domain was found and confirmed by next generation sequencing, RT-PCR, FISH, and/or immunohistochemistry in 3 Spitz neoplasm cases. Compared to controls (wildtype NTRK1 overexpression and GFP), lentiviral mediated overexpression of LMNA-NTRK1 in mouse melanocyte cells (melan-a) displayed increased phosphorylation of the fusion and downstream kinase targets, as assessed by Western Blot. Treatment with the NTRK1 inhibitor, AZ-23, quenched fusion and pathway activation. Additionally, injection of LMNA-NTRK1 melan-a cells into immunocompromised mice resulted in the rapid growth of tumors at the injection site within 40 days. Similar results were observed in mice injected with melan-a cells overexpressing NRAS G12V or HRAS G12V, but no tumors were observed in mice injected with GFP control melan-a cells.\n",
      "- ID 8904: A total of 140 Spitzoid neoplasm cases were analyzed by FISH and/or targeted DNA and RNA sequencing (n=38). Mutually exclusive kinase fusions were found in 72 cases. NTRK1 fusions were observed in 23 cases (8/75 Spitz naevi; 8/32 atypical Spitz tumors; 7/33 Spitzoid melanomas) and their expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. NTRK1 expression was absent in cases without a NTRK1 rearrangement. A 743kb deletion leading to the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 11) with the kinase domain intact was found in 3/38 NGS analyzed cases (1 nevus, 1 atypical, 1Spitzoid) and was verified by RT-PCR.\n",

Anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel revealed a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) fusion that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. Surgical resection was not an option due to tumor size and location. The patient was enrolled into a phase II trial and treated with 600mg of entrectinib daily.

All patients diagnosed with de novo AML (337 children and 1,460 adults) or secondary AML (22 children and 119 adults) received comparable therapy. The study concluded that patients with different cytogenetic abnormalities can be divided into 3 prognostic subgroups with favorable, intermediate, and adverse outcomes solely based on the results of cytogenetics. AML with t(8;21) [which results in RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion] was grouped together with AML with inv(16) [CBFB::MYH11 fusion] and t(15;17) [PML::RARA fusion] in the favorable group. The 122 patients with AML with t(8;21) had a 98% CR (complete remission) rate and 2% induction deaths. The observed prognostic associations further support that these abnormalities define clinically and biologically distinct AML subtypes.\n",
      "- ID 11882: The authors of this 1997 paper compared morphologic and cytochemical features between 30 acute myeloid leukemia subtype M2 (AML-M2) patients with t(8;21)  and  50 AML-M2 patients without t(8;21). Morphologic characteristics highly enriched in cases positive for t(8;21) included irregular nuclear shape, Auer bodies, at least 90% myeloperoxidase positivity in blast cells, pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly of the nuclei, and homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils. These features were observed in 90-100% of the t(8;21) positive cases and were rare in the t(8;21) negative group. Homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils was the most characteristic of t(8;21)positive AML-M2, while pale-colored cytoplasm without any granules in mature neutrophils or dyserythropoietic features was never observed in association with t(8;21). The study suggests association of the t(8;21) with a subtype of AML that has morphologically recognizable features in a high proportion of cases.  Of note, AML with t(8;21) translocation is now known to result in a RUNX1::RUNX1T fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11878: In this 1992 study, the authors isolated a clone containing the junction region of the (8;21)(q22;q22) translocation characteristic for acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21). Using probes from the junction clone, the presence of this consistent junction region was confirmed in 9 independent cases of AML with t(8;21). The authors also isolated cDNA clones from a t(8;21) AML cDNA library that contained fused sequences from chromosomes 8 and 21. This allowed them to identify the chromosome 8 partner gene which they named ETO (currently known as RUNX1T1) and confirm the chromosome 21 partner as AML1 (currently RUNX1), which showed similarity with the Drosophila segmentation gene, runt. The consequence of the t(8;21) was determined to be the juxtaposition of 5' sequences of AML1 (RUNX1) to 3' sequences of ETO (RUNX1T1), oriented telomere to centromere on the der(8) chromosome. The study confirms that t(8;21) consistently results in an oncogenic fusion between specific partner genes, confirming its role as a defining oncogenic abnormality in a subtype of AML.\n",
      "- ID 11879: The researchers analyzed immunophenotype in 30 cases of newly diagnosed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibiting M2 morphology per French-American-British classification. They correlated these findings with cytogenetic data. In 16 out of the 30 cases, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation or its variants were detected. The leukemias harboring t(8;21) did not significantly vary from other M2 cases regarding expression of various cell surface markers like CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD36, CD41a, CD42b, CDw65, TdT, or HLA-DR. However, the B-cell antigen CD19 expression was observed in 81% of t(8;21) cases compared to only 7% of non-t(8;21) M2 cases. Moreover, 63% of t(8;21) cases exhibited the NK-cell antigen CD56 expression versus 14% of non-t(8;21) M2 leukemias. Coexpression of CD19 and CD56 was exclusively found in the t(8;21) group. This coexpression pattern was absent in 48 cases of other AML subtypes lacking t(8;21). Additionally, non-t(8;21) M2 cases frequently expressed CD2 or CD7, while none of the t(8;21) cases did. The authors deduced that t(8;21) defines a biologically unique pediatric M2 AML subgroup with distinct immunophenotypic features differentiating it from other de novo AML types.\n",

      "- ID 8930: Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis of a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk) revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. RNA sequencing of detected a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Larotrectinib therapy achieved remission of the patient’s two separate relapses. Patient derived xenografts injected into mice and treated with Larotrectinib demonstrated significant reductions in spleen volume, blasts in spleen, and blast in bone marrow (p < .0001) compared to controls 25 days after injection. Larotrectinib treatment was effective regardless of the day of initiation post xenograft injection (1 day or 8 days after).\n",
      "- ID 6930: Both in vivo and in vitro models demonstrated Larotrectinib was an effective treatment against cells harboring ETV6-NTRK3. In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 8917: All lines of conventional therapy (including allogeneic HSCT, blinatumomab, and CAR T cells) were inefficient for a 6-year-old boy with B-cell ALL and CNS infiltration (National Cancer Institute high risk). Conventional cytogenetics, FISH, and an Abbott break-apart probe of a peripheral blood sample collected at diagnosis revealed an unbalance translocation of the ETV6 locus. The patient relapsed twice and RNA sequencing of the initial diagnosis sample revealed a cytogenetically cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. Treatment with larotrectinib was initiated in combination with etoposide and methotrexate resulted in molecular remission in 66 days in bone marrow and CNS. A third relapse occurred 45 days after Larotrectinib was paused for CAR-T infusions. Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration.\n",
      "- ID 8931: The tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 was inserted into exon 6 of Etv6 to create conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK3 mice . Expression was induced in pre-b cells during lymphoid development by CD19-Cre. Fusion expression in the bone marrow was confirmed by RT-PCR. Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice developed aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Compared to controls (Etv6-NTRK3/+; n=28), Etv6-NTRK3/+ CD19-Cre mice (n=27) displayed worse overall survival (p<.0001), decreased body weight (p<.0001), increased spleen weights (p<.05), and increased circulating CD19+/B220+ cells (p=.0008). Over 60% of Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice demonstrated extramedullary tumors and over 50% presented with central nervous system infiltration. RNA-sequencing indicated upregulation of the AP1 complex in the Etv6-NTRK3 CD19-Cre mice. The authors conclude this ETV6-NTRK3 Cre-19 mouse model mimics human B-ALL.\n",
      "- ID 6099: Four out of six patients with infantile fibrosarcoma and a ETV6-NTRK3 fusion had a partial response, the remaining two had a complete response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",
      "- ID 11603: An analysis of 85 small blue round cell tumors (SBRCTs) that were negative for EWSR1, CIC, or BCOR by FISH identified 6 FUS::ERG and 1 FUS::FEV fusions.  Clinicopathologic characterization of these 7 cases with FUS fusions and 8 FUS-rearranged SBRCTs reported in the literature described the morphology as monomorphic round cell cytomorphology (keeping with a classic Ewing sarcoma phenotype) with diffuse membranous CD99 reactivity in all except one case with patchy staining.  Of note, there were 4 patients in this group who had scored negative for EWSR1 FISH that were positive for EWSR1::ERG  by other means (FusionSeq, RT-PCR, etc.) and the authors caution of the false negatives with EWSR1 FISH due to the complexity of the the EWSR1::ERG rearrangement.  The authors conclude that these rarer alternative fusions also lead to classic Ewing sarcoma.\n",
      "- ID 475: The t(21;22) rearrangement resulting in the EWSR1::ERG fusion is associated with the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma. EWSR1::ERG is the second most common gene fusion reported in this disease.\n",
      "- ID 10338: Molecular analysis of 30 Ewing tumors (designated as Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) in this 1994 paper) from patients with well-documented clinical course was performed.   RT-PCR revealed fusion transcripts in 28 of 30 cases (93%) with EWSR1::FLI1 found in 93% (26 of 28) and EWSR1::ERG in 7% (2 of 28).  Of note, these fusions were not identified in 7 tumors of other diagnoses.   The two tumors with EWSR1::ERG had breakpoints between exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 6 of ERG with a t(2;22) rearrangement detected in 1 of these 2 cases by karyotyping.  Authors conclude RT-PCR is a sensitive method for identifying these EWSR1 rearranged tumors.\n",

      "- ID 4943: In a study of 114 unrelated VHL affected families, germline mutations in the VHL gene were identified in 85 of the families. VHL mutations were detected in affected family members, but not in unaffected family members or 96 normal individuals, however it seems unaffected family members were not tested genetically for the mutations. Mutations in the VHL gene were detected by SSCP and DNA sequencing. Haplotypes were determined with four microsatellite polymorphic probes. The missense mutation L184P (c.551T>C) (In the paper noted as nucleotide position 764 and codon position 255 due to old reference transcript), was found in 2 individuals in family 3708. Both individuals were identified with renal cell carcinoma and one also presented with a CNS hemangioblastoma. Additional information regarding the family information, including a pedigree, were not provided. ACMG evidence codes: 'flag for PP4' since the patients phenotype and family history is consistent with VHL, 'flag for PP1' because there is co-segregation of variant with the phenotype in two members of the family.\n",
      "- ID 8491: Of 14 patients with retinal vascular proliferation and known family history of VHL disease, 12 patients were enrolled in an approved study protocol at the National Cancer Institute. 11 of these patients underwent genetic testing and were found to have mutations in the VHL gene. Patient 1 presented with retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH) in her left eye at age the age of 13, which was treated with radiation. At age 62 years, this eye had good visual acuity (20/20) without any RCHs. As of her last visit, patient 1 also presented with abnormalities in the CNS, pancreas and kidney. She was found to have the L184P (c.551T>C) mutation. Her last known age was 69 years old. ACMG evidence codes: 'PP4' since the patient presents phenotypes highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 6119: Thirty-five unrelated patients suspected of having von Hippel-Lindau disease had genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes analyzed using sequence analysis of the coding region for VHL / Southern blot analyses. 32 VHL gene variants were found in 35 patients. An association of clear cell renal carcinoma development with a relatively high loss of structural stability in VHL protein missense mutations was discovered, although this only reached significance when combining data from other studies (p=0.101 for present study; p=0.0086 for present study + other study data). This missense variant was found in a patient with spinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, retinal hemangioblastomas, pancreatic cysts, renal cysts, and cysts of the broad ligament (patient no. F43). The patient was 27 years old. ACMG PP4 as patient's phenotypes are highly specific for VHL disease.\n",
      "- ID 5055: 93 families that fulfilled the clinical criteria of VHL disease were assessed for germline mutations in the VHL gene, and mutations were found in all affected family members. The c.551T>C (p.L184P) mutation was found in a family (Lineage 14) in which members were clinically diagnosed with VHL presenting without pheochromocytoma (VHL type 1), however, no further phenotypic information about specific patients was provided. This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript (AF010238.1). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot. Relevant ACMG codes include: PP4, because the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.\n",
      "- ID 12009: RNA sequencing identified NUTM1 fusions in six patients with primary undifferentiated soft tissue and visceral tumors.  Fusions included BRD4::NUTM1 (three cases), BRD3::NUTM1, MXD1::NUTM1, and BCORL1::NUTM1, however only the BRD4::NUTM1 and BRD3::NUTM1 cases were positive for NUTM1 IHC.   Independent testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of the NUTM1 and partner gene rearrangement.  The breakpoints were located at NUTM1 exon 3 or 5 (NM_001284292.1) and BRD4 exon 11 (NM_058243.2) or BRD3 exon 9 (NM_007371.3). Despite some overlap with NUT midline carcinoma, the authors note that the tumors observed also differed in several ways, tentatively labeled these malignant neoplasms as \"NUT-associated tumors\", and speculate that they might represent an overarching category that also includes NUT midline carcinoma.\n",
      "- ID 12050: In this 2020 study, the authors included a total of 141 NUT carcinomas defined by rearrangement of NUTM1 detected by IHC, cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The median age at diagnosis was 24 years (range of 18 days to 80 years). Fusion partners were confirmed by either cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The majority  (78%) of tumors harbored a BRD4::NUTM1 fusion, 15% harbored a BRD3::NUTM1  fusion, 6% harbored a NSD3::NUTM1 fusion, 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF532::NUTM1 fusion and 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF592::NUTM1 fusion. For the remaining 14 cases the fusion partner gene to NUTM1 was not identified. The majority of tumors arose from the thorax or head and neck, but tumors were also seen in bone, soft tissue, and kidney. Outcomes in patients were overall poor, however, the authors conclude that they have identified three clinically and molecularly defined prognostic risk groups: group A is nonthoracic, BRD3::NUTM1, or NSD3::NUTM1 with a significantly improved prognosis (OS of 36.5 months); group B is nonthoracic, BRD4::NUTM1 with a poor prognosis (OS of 10 months); and group C is thoracic with a very poor prognosis (OS of 3.5 to 5.6 months) regardless of the NUTM1 fusion partner.\n",
      "- ID 12049: In this 2017 study, the authors sought to characterize NUT carcinomas. They included a cohort of 12 aggressive malignant tumors with rearrangement of the NUTM1 gene, assessed by RT-PCR, FISH, positive nuclear NUTM1 immunohistochemistry, and/or t(15; 19) detection by cytogenetics. The median age at onset was 18 years (with a range of 12 –50 years). RT-PCR or FISH confirmed the fusion partner as BRD4 in 9 of 12 cases, and a finding of t(15;19) (q13;p13) by cytogenetics confirmed BRD4 as the partner in 1 case.  All cases tested had positive anti-NUTM1 antibody immunostaining. The primary tumor was found to be lateralized in two-thirds of the cases, rather than localized to the midline, supporting the change in name from \"NUT midline carcinoma\" to \"NUT carcinoma\". The authors state that 50% of cases initially had an alternative diagnosis and recommend NUTM1-specific antibody immunostaining in cases of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinoma to properly diagnose NUT carcinoma at an earlier stage.\n",
      "- ID 12051: In this 2004 study, the authors sought to identify carcinomas with translocation t(15;19)(q13, p13.1), which results in the novel oncogenic fusion BRD4::NUTM1 (described as NUT). The authors screened malignant tumors with epithelial differentiation, in patients less than 40 years of age, with poorly differentiated histomorphology, rapid clinical progression, and/or cytogenetic evidence of chromosome 15q or 19p rearrangement. In total, using FISH with dual-color assays evaluating chromosome 19p13.1 BRD4 and 15q13 NUTM1 breakpoints, they detected 11 tumors to have a NUTM1 rearrangement, with 7 of the cases detected in 98 previously unscreened samples and the others in known positive cases. Patients with a NUTM1 rearrangement ranged from 3 to 35 years of age. The NUTM1 rearrangement was consistent with BRD4::NUTM1 in 8/11 cases and 3/11 were found to have a rearrangement of NUTM1 but not BRD4, suggesting the existence of other rearrangements involving NUTM1 which the authors designate NUT-variant carcinomas. The authors conclude that NUTM1 rearranged carcinomas can arise from various midline epithelial surfaces and are associated with poor outcome.\n",
      "- ID 4858: In a randomized, open-label phase 3 trial 303 patients with ALK-positive, previously untreated NSCLC (including asympt. CNS disease) were randomized to reiceive either Alectinib or Crizotinib. During a median follow-up of 17.6 months (crizotinib) and 18.6 months (alectinib), an event of disease progression/death occurred in 41% (62/152  pt) in the alectinib group and 68% (102/151 patients) in the crizotinib group. 12-month event-free survival rate 68.4% with alectinib vs. 48.7% with crizotinib. A total of 18 patients (12%) in the alectinib group had an event of CNS progression, compared to 68 patients (45%) in the crizotinib group. Response rates were 82.9% (Alectinib) and 75.5% (crizotinib).\n",
      "- ID 1200: This retrospective study of patients from the PROFILE 1001 and 1005 studies of crizotinib in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC assessed the potential benefit of crizotinib beyond progressive disease (CBPD), defined as continuation of crizotinib for 3 or more weeks after disease progression on crizotinib. 194 patients who had developed PD by data cutoff were studied, where 120 received crizotinib for a median duration of 19.4 weeks and 74 discontinued crizotinib after PD. No gross imbalances in clinicopathologic features of the two groups were evident.  Significantly longer overall survival was observed in the crizotinib continuing group from time of PD (16.4 vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17–0.42; P < 0.0001), and from the time of initial crizotinib (29.6 vs. 10.8 months; HR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19–0.46; P < 0.0001).\n",
      "- ID 1201: This prospective Phase III study named Profile 1014 on NSCLC ALK-rearranged patients assessed intracranial disease control rate (IC-DCR) in the subset of patients entering the study with preexisting treated brain metastasis (tBM). IC-DCR was significantly improved in the tBM group given crizotinib (N=39) over chemotherapy (pemetrexed + cisplatin or carboplatin; N=40) at 12 weeks (85% vs. 45%, P<0.001), and at 24 weeks (56% vs. 25%, P=0.006). Progression free survival was also significantly improved with crizotinib over chemotherapy in the tBM subgroup (9.0 vs. 4.0 months; HR 0.40; P<0.001), where in the intent to treat population it was 10.9 vs. 7.0 months (HR 0.45; P<0.001), indicating that the difficult to treat BM population obtained benefit from crizotinib at both the brain and systemic level.\n",
      "- ID 1419: In a retrospective study comparing survival outcomes in a subgroup of 82 ALK-positive crizotinib-treated patients enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT00585195), crizotinib therapy was associated with improved survival. For the crizotinib-treated, ALK-positive patient group, 1 year survival was 74% and 2 year overall survival was 54%, compared with 72% and 36% for the control group (ALK-positive crizotinib naive patients).\n",
      "- ID 1577: A phase-3 clinical trial evaluated 347 patients with ALK-positive lung cancer.  The study compared crizotinib treatment (n=173) with chemotherapy treatment of either pemetrexed or docetaxel (n=174).  In the crizotinib arm, the response rate was significantly higher (65% vs 20%; P<0.001), the progression-free survival was increased (7.7 months vs. 3.0 months; HR=0.49, 95%CI:14 months-26 months; p<0.001), however, there was no significant improvement in overall survival (HR=1.02; 95%CI:0.68-1.54; P=0.54).  Of the patients on crizotinib treatment, global quality of life was improved relative to baseline when compared to chemotherapy patients (+5 mean change, -5 mean change; P<0.001).\n",
      "- ID 1691: In an evaluation of a patient with crizotinib-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma, an EML4-ALK-E13;A20 rearrangement was identified using CGP.  The patient attained a reduction in the target lesions by 14.2%, however, the patient relapsed 17 months later.\n",
      "- ID 1187: In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.\n",
      "- ID 1207: In the PROFILE 1001 study of crizotinib in 82 patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, 31 patients with sufficient tumor material were tested using RT-PCR for the presence of certain EML4-ALK variants.  13/31 tested patients had the EML4-ALK variant 1. Of these, 12/13 had a partial response, and 1 had stable disease. This response rate of 92% is in contrast to the 57% response rate in the overall patient population, but the numbers of patients with specific EML4-ALK breakpoints were insufficient to correlate with patient response rate.\n",
      "- ID 1245: This case study presented a 53-year-old never-smoker with a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm. Morphology and immunohistochemistry were unable to establish the primary tumor site. Right upper extremity (RUE), scalp, and multiple lung lesions were apparent. A lung lesion sample with sufficient material for molecular profiling was not attainable but sufficient material was present from the RUE for hybrid capture genomic profiling  (FoundationOne kit was used). EML4-ALK variant 3 was found, and the patient was started on crizotinib. Rapid symptom improvement was seen. After 1 month, a CT scan showed significant size reduction in lung tumors, and after 5 months the patient was asymptomatic with an entirely negative examination.\n",
      "- ID 1189: In the PROFILE 1001 study, from 31 NSCLC tumors positive for ALK fusions with sufficient material for RT-PCR aided exon breakpoint identification, 1 case of EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) was found. This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.\n",
      "- ID 1196: EML4-ALK variants v1 (E13;A20), v2 (E20;A20), v3a (E6;A20) and v3b (E6ins33;A20) were expressed in Ba/F3 cells using retrovirus.  While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.\n",
      "- ID 1190: Multiplex RT-PCR to detect in-frame fusions of EML4 to ALK was performed on total RNA from 253 lung adenocarcinomas, and 9 samples were found to contain such fusions, one of which was a novel fusion containing EML4 exon 2 and exon 20 of ALK. This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.\n",
      "- ID 1193: In a set of 31 patients with NSCLC, RT-PCR was performed to test for known EML4-ALK variants.  Five patients tested positive for the 3a/3b EML4-ALK variant.  Of these, 4 had partial response (PR), and one had disease progression (DP), and this was the only DP in the group of 31.  In contrast, of the 13 testing positive for EML4-ALK variant 1, 12 showed PR, and 1 showed stable disease.  These results potentially mirror findings in the H2228 3a/3b containing NSCLC cell line where some literature indicates it does respond as strongly to ALK inhibition as other EML4-ALK NSCLC cell lines.\n",

The IC50 for parental Ba/F3 supplemented with IL3 was 2299 nM, resulting in a fold difference of 209.2 for EML4-ALK and 55.1 for NPM-ALK, indicating some reduced sensitivity for NPM-ALK in direct comparison to EML4-ALK, but substantial sensitization to crizotinib for NPM-ALK in Ba/F3 cells.\n",

One of those profiles included CNS neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (CNS NB-FOXR2) which was seen in 14% (44/323) of the tumors. Genome-wide sequencing detected gene rearrangements involving the full-length coding sequence of FOXR2 with fusion partners JMJD1C, LOC550643, JPX, MAGEH1, or MAGED2 that resulted in high expression of FOXR2. The authors proposed that CNS NB-FOXR2 defines a specific molecular subtype of CNS neuroblastoma tumors.\n",

Patients with LGFMS ranged from 22 to 53 years of age.  All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement.  EWSR1::CREB3L1 was detected in SEF.  The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF while FUS::CREB3L2 is common in LGFMS, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.\n",

Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse subcutaneous tissue thickening without significant involvement of underlying soft tissue. Punch biopsy demonstrated small whorls and fascicles of bland spindled cells with no mitotic activity, atypical mitotic figures, or nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical staining resulted in CD34 positivity in the lesional cells, negative S100-protein in the spindle cells, and positive Pan-Trk staining in the spindled-cells. Transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) revealed the presence of an in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 fusion (exon4::exon10) that includes the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. According to the authors, this case presents grounds to use pan-Trk staining to determine the diagnosis of LPF versus LPF-NT S100 detection can vary in rare instances.\n",
      "- ID 11577: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion. Biopsy revealed a spindle cell mesenchymal tumor with monotonous, bland spindle cells mixed with fat and blood vessels. IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Due to the unusual tumor location, an anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel was used and detected a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. The author’s reclassified their diagnosis to an S-100 positive LPF-NT of the spine based on the identification of the fusion.\n",

Biopsy demonstrated a fascicular proliferation of bland spindle cells within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and was found in adipose tissue in a “honeycomb pattern.” Immunohistochemical staining revealed the spindle cells were positive for CD34 and S-100 protein and were negative for SOX10. FISH was negative for PDGFB rearrangement. The spindle cells were positive for pan-NTRK by IHC and targeted RNA sequencing revealed the LMNA::NTRK1 e2::e10 fusion. The patient’s tumor was completely excised, and no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease was found at 24-month follow-up.

In this article, a group of superficial soft tissue tumors occurring in children and young adults, with a notably infiltrative growth pattern reminiscent of LPF, variable cytologic atypia, and a distinct immunoprofile of S100 protein and CD34 reactivity, suggestive of neural differentiation, is described. To better characterize this group, genomic characterization (RNA sequencing) revealed NTRK1 fusions (TPR-NTRK1 and TPM3-NTRK1) in two index cases and in 10/14 additional cases (FISH).

      "- ID 9588: One patient was identified with a LMNA-NTRK1 positive tumor in this Phase I study (NCT02122913), which involved 70 heavily pretreated patients with a median age of 59.5 years, with multiple solid tumor types. A total of eight patients had NTRK fusions, and by independent radiology review, all patients with TRK fusion were considered to have had an objective response. The average time on treatment was 28.4 months for patients with NTRK fusion cancer, compared to 1.8 months for those without an NTRK fusion. Authors concluded that NTRK fusions may represent tissue and age agnostic oncogenic drivers, and that Larotrectinib was well tolerated in the patients and demonstrated activity in all tumors with NTRK fusions.\n",
      "- ID 11576: A 31-year-old female presented with a pigmented nodule on her scalp that enlarged in size over a 2-year period. Biopsy demonstrated a fascicular proliferation of bland spindle cells within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and was found in adipose tissue in a “honeycomb pattern.” Immunohistochemical staining revealed the spindle cells were positive for CD34 and S-100 protein and were negative for SOX10. FISH was negative for PDGFB rearrangement. The spindle cells were positive for pan-NTRK by IHC and targeted RNA sequencing revealed the LMNA::NTRK1 e2::e10 fusion. The patient’s tumor was completely excised, and no evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease was found at 24-month follow-up. The authors indicate the tumor analyses demonstrate a diagnosis of a NTRK-rearranged LPF-NT with unusual histopathological findings that include lymphoid aggregates and pigmented dendritic melanocytes.\n",
      "- ID 11577: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion. Biopsy revealed a spindle cell mesenchymal tumor with monotonous, bland spindle cells mixed with fat and blood vessels. IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Due to the unusual tumor location, an anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel was used and detected a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. The author’s reclassified their diagnosis to an S-100 positive LPF-NT of the spine based on the identification of the fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11578: A 21-year-old man demonstrated intermittent abdominal pain, and a CT scan revealed an abnormal paraspinal lesion.  IHC was positive for CD34, S-100, and pan-TRK and negative for Sox10. Anchored multiplex PCR-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) RNA fusion panel revealed a predicted in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 (e2:e11) fusion that retains the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. This fusion was confirmed by RT-PCT and Sanger. Surgical resection was not an option due to tumor size and location. The patient was enrolled into a phase II trial and treated with 600mg of entrectinib daily. After 1 month, the mass showed near-complete loss of enhancement and density (Hounsfield units dropped from 200 to 55-60). At week 12, response plateau was reached with the lesion reducing by 45% (RECIST 1.1). Due to the exceptional response, vertebrectomy was possible and completed. The patient continued entrectinib and has been recurrence free for 7 months.\n",
      "- ID 11650: A 3-year-old girl presented with spots on her right buttock that evolved into lumps. Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse subcutaneous tissue thickening without significant involvement of underlying soft tissue. Punch biopsy demonstrated small whorls and fascicles of bland spindled cells with no mitotic activity, atypical mitotic figures, or nuclear pleomorphism. Immunohistochemical staining resulted in CD34 positivity in the lesional cells, negative S100-protein in the spindle cells, and positive Pan-Trk staining in the spindled-cells. Transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) revealed the presence of an in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 fusion (exon4::exon10) that includes the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain. According to the authors, this case presents grounds to use pan-Trk staining to determine the diagnosis of LPF versus LPF-NT S100 detection can vary in rare instances.\n",
      "- ID 11354: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, the entrectinib retained activity against both the wild type and the NTRK1 F589L gatekeeper mutation with IC50s of 0.30 +/- 0.1 and <0.2 nM respectively.\n",
      "- ID 11349: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, the first generation inhibitor larotrectinib was 28-150 fold less active against fusions with mutations in the NTRK1 kinase domain.  The IC50 for LMNA:NTRK1 with no mutation was 23.5 nM while the IC50s for the LMNA:NTRK1 fusion with G595R (solvent front), F589L (gatekeeper), or G667C (xDFG) mutation were 3540, 675, and 1630 nM respectively.\n",
      "- ID 11346: In a head-to-head comparison of 4 NTRK inhibitors (larotrectinib, entrectinib, repotrectinib, and selitrectinib) with Ba/F3 cells harboring LMNA::NTRK1 with or without kinase domain mutations, repotrectinib retained the greatest activity against fusions with mutations in the NTRK1 kinase domain.  The Ba/F3 proliferation IC50 for LMNA:NTRK1 with no mutation was <0.2 nM while the IC50s for the LMNA:NTRK1 fusion with G595R (solvent front), F589L (gatekeeper), G667C (xDFG), or G595R+F589L were 0.2, <0.2, 11.8, and 17.7 respectively. Repotrectinib also inhibited autophosphorylation of LMNA:NTRK1 in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the construct at low concentrations.\n",
      "- ID 10095: BaF3 cells were transduced with a number of NTRK fusions. IC50 values were measured following treatment with entrectinib: TPM3-NTRK1 (2.5nM), LMNA-NTRK1 (1.4nM), ETV6-NTRK1 (2.5nM), VCL-NTRK2 (4.3nM), AFAP1-NTRK2 (2.7nM), ETV6-NTRK2 (4.5nM), ETV6-NTRK3 (3.8nM), and control (>1000nM).\n",
      "- ID 8901: FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft of a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 10 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Expression was confirmed by Western and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. Western blot of the tumor also indicated constitutive activation of the fusion based on phosphorylation of the fusion. Additionally, downstream kinase targets (PLCγ1, AKT, and MAPK) were also phosphorylated in the tumor, similar to levels observed in the TPM3-NTRK1 containing KM12 colorectal cancer cell line.\n",
      "- ID 8900: After disease progression with no objective response to therapy, a 75-year-old with metastatic colorectal cancer that spread to the liver displayed elevated NTRK1 expression in both primary tumor and liver metastasis as measured by immunohistochemistry. FISH of the tumor and patient derived xenograft indicated NTRK1 involvement. 5’RACE PCR discovered a novel LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 11 & exon 10), which resulted in the expression of two different fusion splice transcripts (exons 1-10 with exons 10-16 and exons 1-11 with exons 10-16). Fusion expression of both transcripts was confirmed by western blot, and Sanger sequencing revealed the fusion to be in-frame with the kinase domain intact. After 4 weeks of treatment with Entrectinib, CT scan revealed the patient showed a partial response with a 30% reduction of target lesions. This response was maintained for 5 months.\n",
      "- ID 2955: LOXO-101 is an orally administered inhibitor of the TRK kinase and is highly selective only for the TRK family of receptors. The tumor of a 41-year-old woman with soft-tissue sarcoma metastatic to the lung was found to harbor an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 (exon 2 & exon 11) gene fusion encoding a functional LMNA-TRKA fusion oncoprotein. This patient's tumors underwent rapid and substantial tumor regression, with an accompanying improvement in pulmonary dyspnea, oxygen saturation, and plasma tumor markers.\n",
      "- ID 2960: A gene fusion between exon 11 of LMNA and exon 10 of NTRK1 was observed in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer after therapy with first-line FOLFOX, second-line FOLFIRI/cetuximab, and third-line irinotecan. The patient treated in a clinical trial with pan-TRK kinase inhibitor entrectinib. Treatment was well tolerated and led to a partial response (PR) with 30% tumor shrinkage of multiple liver metastases. Clinical response lasted 4 months.\n",
      "- ID 6100: One Patient with soft tissue sarcoma and a NTRK1-LMNA fusion had a partial response with larotrectinib. Treatment was done within a multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion Status. In total, 24 patients (n=17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n=7 without a documented TRK fusion) were enrolled. Among the fusion-positive patients, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.\n",
      "- ID 6391: A 14-month-old boy presented with a slow-growing, asymptomatic back plaque, which was biopsied and found to have S100 positivity, sparse CD34 staining, and no significant mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism, or necrosis. IHC detected cytoplasmic expression of NTRK1 and FISH detected the LMNA::NTRK1 fusion. Based on these findings the authors conclude this is patient has a lipofibromatosis-like neural tumor (LPF-NT). The patient was treated with wide local excision and has developed no complications or evidence of recurrence with 6 months of follow-up time. LPF-NT is rare, with 14 cases previously reported, and this patient was the first report of this diagnosis in infancy.\n",
      "- ID 8878: A mass found at birth in a patient’s left arm became enlarged at age 2 and was resected and characterized as a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma. FISH and RT-PCR did not detect any common sarcoma translocations. A recurrence and a new mass formed after 4 months of therapy, so amputation was performed. Metastatic high-grade sarcoma appeared in the lungs 4 months later followed by multiple recurrences 10 months after treatment. Whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of diagnosis and normal samples were performed and the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact was discovered. Treatment with Crizotinib was started and a chest CT after 2 months revealed partial response. After 22 months of therapy, chest CT revealed a complete response of lung nodules, which has been sustained >18 months beyond the conclusion of treatment at 31 months.\n",
      "- ID 8902: A 40-year-old patient with a left calf mass revealed by biopsy to be a low grade myxoid spindle cell carcinoma underwent surgery and radiotherapy. Over a 5-year period, the patient experienced 3 lung metastases, which were all resected. At year 6, unresectable metastases were found in the lungs and lymph nodes. FISH and targeted next generation RNA sequencing of an earlier lung metastasis revealed and confirmed an in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 10) with the kinase domain intact. TRK inhibitor was administered and PET-CT scan revealed near complete response and no new lesions 1 year later.\n",
      "- ID 8903: The in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 11) with intact kinase domain was found and confirmed by next generation sequencing, RT-PCR, FISH, and/or immunohistochemistry in 3 Spitz neoplasm cases. Compared to controls (wildtype NTRK1 overexpression and GFP), lentiviral mediated overexpression of LMNA-NTRK1 in mouse melanocyte cells (melan-a) displayed increased phosphorylation of the fusion and downstream kinase targets, as assessed by Western Blot. Treatment with the NTRK1 inhibitor, AZ-23, quenched fusion and pathway activation. Additionally, injection of LMNA-NTRK1 melan-a cells into immunocompromised mice resulted in the rapid growth of tumors at the injection site within 40 days. Similar results were observed in mice injected with melan-a cells overexpressing NRAS G12V or HRAS G12V, but no tumors were observed in mice injected with GFP control melan-a cells.\n",
      "- ID 8904: A total of 140 Spitzoid neoplasm cases were analyzed by FISH and/or targeted DNA and RNA sequencing (n=38). Mutually exclusive kinase fusions were found in 72 cases. NTRK1 fusions were observed in 23 cases (8/75 Spitz naevi; 8/32 atypical Spitz tumors; 7/33 Spitzoid melanomas) and their expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. NTRK1 expression was absent in cases without a NTRK1 rearrangement. A 743kb deletion leading to the in-frame LMNA-NTRK1 fusion (exon 2 & exon 11) with the kinase domain intact was found in 3/38 NGS analyzed cases (1 nevus, 1 atypical, 1Spitzoid) and was verified by RT-PCR.\n",
      "- ID 11280: In an analysis of 22 cases of mesoblastic nephroma, 4 of 5 (80%) cellular mesoblastic nephromas harbored ETV6::NTRK3, 1 of 5 cellular mesoblastic nephromas harbored a KLHL7::BRAF fusion, 12 of 12 (100%) classic mesoblastic nephromas harbored EGFR ITD, 4 of 5 of mixed histology had EGFR ITD, and 1 of 5 of mixed histology had the  ETV6::NTRK3 fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11279: In an analysis of 19 cases of mesoblastic nephroma, the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion was detected in 0 of 5 of the classic mesoblastic nephroma, 8 of 8 (100%) of the cellular mesoblastic nephroma and 5 of 6 (83%) of the mixed mesoblastic nephroma cohorts.\n",
      "- ID 10841: A frequent genetic alteration in congenital mesoblastic nephroma is the translocation t(12;15) resulting in a fusion of the ETV6 gene on 12p13 and the NTRK3 gene on 15p15 that occurs almost exclusively in cellular mesoblastic nephroma subtype.  In a group of 111 mesoblastic nephroma (MN) samples, 79 were were evaluable by FISH, which consisted of 38 classical MN, 29 cellular MN, and 12 mixed MN samples. 16 of 29 cellular type MN had ETV6::NTRK3 via break apart FISH, while 0/38 classical and 0/12 mixed types were positive.\n",
      "- ID 11880: This study evaluated the independent prognostic significance of pretreatment cytogenetics based on the large Medical Research Council (MRC) AML 10 trial which enrolled a total of 1,966 patients (364 children and 1,602 adults). All patients diagnosed with de novo AML (337 children and 1,460 adults) or secondary AML (22 children and 119 adults) received comparable therapy. The study concluded that patients with different cytogenetic abnormalities can be divided into 3 prognostic subgroups with favorable, intermediate, and adverse outcomes solely based on the results of cytogenetics. AML with t(8;21) [which results in RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion] was grouped together with AML with inv(16) [CBFB::MYH11 fusion] and t(15;17) [PML::RARA fusion] in the favorable group. The 122 patients with AML with t(8;21) had a 98% CR (complete remission) rate and 2% induction deaths. The observed prognostic associations further support that these abnormalities define clinically and biologically distinct AML subtypes.\n",
      "- ID 11882: The authors of this 1997 paper compared morphologic and cytochemical features between 30 acute myeloid leukemia subtype M2 (AML-M2) patients with t(8;21)  and  50 AML-M2 patients without t(8;21). Morphologic characteristics highly enriched in cases positive for t(8;21) included irregular nuclear shape, Auer bodies, at least 90% myeloperoxidase positivity in blast cells, pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly of the nuclei, and homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils. These features were observed in 90-100% of the t(8;21) positive cases and were rare in the t(8;21) negative group. Homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils was the most characteristic of t(8;21)positive AML-M2, while pale-colored cytoplasm without any granules in mature neutrophils or dyserythropoietic features was never observed in association with t(8;21). The study suggests association of the t(8;21) with a subtype of AML that has morphologically recognizable features in a high proportion of cases.  Of note, AML with t(8;21) translocation is now known to result in a RUNX1::RUNX1T fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11878: In this 1992 study, the authors isolated a clone containing the junction region of the (8;21)(q22;q22) translocation characteristic for acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21). Using probes from the junction clone, the presence of this consistent junction region was confirmed in 9 independent cases of AML with t(8;21). The authors also isolated cDNA clones from a t(8;21) AML cDNA library that contained fused sequences from chromosomes 8 and 21. This allowed them to identify the chromosome 8 partner gene which they named ETO (currently known as RUNX1T1) and confirm the chromosome 21 partner as AML1 (currently RUNX1), which showed similarity with the Drosophila segmentation gene, runt. The consequence of the t(8;21) was determined to be the juxtaposition of 5' sequences of AML1 (RUNX1) to 3' sequences of ETO (RUNX1T1), oriented telomere to centromere on the der(8) chromosome. The study confirms that t(8;21) consistently results in an oncogenic fusion between specific partner genes, confirming its role as a defining oncogenic abnormality in a subtype of AML.\n",
      "- ID 11879: The researchers analyzed immunophenotype in 30 cases of newly diagnosed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibiting M2 morphology per French-American-British classification. They correlated these findings with cytogenetic data. In 16 out of the 30 cases, the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation or its variants were detected. The leukemias harboring t(8;21) did not significantly vary from other M2 cases regarding expression of various cell surface markers like CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD36, CD41a, CD42b, CDw65, TdT, or HLA-DR. However, the B-cell antigen CD19 expression was observed in 81% of t(8;21) cases compared to only 7% of non-t(8;21) M2 cases. Moreover, 63% of t(8;21) cases exhibited the NK-cell antigen CD56 expression versus 14% of non-t(8;21) M2 leukemias. Coexpression of CD19 and CD56 was exclusively found in the t(8;21) group. This coexpression pattern was absent in 48 cases of other AML subtypes lacking t(8;21). Additionally, non-t(8;21) M2 cases frequently expressed CD2 or CD7, while none of the t(8;21) cases did. The authors deduced that t(8;21) defines a biologically unique pediatric M2 AML subgroup with distinct immunophenotypic features differentiating it from other de novo AML types.\n",

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined.

Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy.\n",

The refractory or relapsed AML FLT wildtype group treated with gilteritinib(n=58) had lower overall response rate (12%), complete remission (2%), complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (0%), complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery (7%), and fewer reached partiral remission (3%). Also, bone marrow myeloblast reduction was greater in FLT3 mutant patients compared to FLT3 wildtype.\n",
      "- ID 8923: This study was designed to test the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in vitro against FLT3-ITD and other TKD variants clinically observed. IC50s were determined from immunoblots quantifying FLT3 phosphorylation in endogenous (Molm14) or ectopic expression FLT3-ITD cell lines (TF-1, Ba/F3) and the endogenous wildtype FLT3 SEMK2 cell line after gilteritinib treatment. IC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 1.8 nM in the three FLT3-ITD lines compared to 5nM in wildtype cells, suggesting increased sensitivity to the inhibitor. As measured by MTT assay, primary cultures from two AML patients with high allelic FLT3-ITD showed cytotoxic response to gilteritinib. Additionally, plasma taken from 3 patients receiving 120mg of gilteritinib daily was able to inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation in Molm14 cells.\n",
      "- ID 8924: In vitro gilteritinib treatment of MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells, which endogenously express FLT3-ITD, showed growth suppression based on CellTiter GLO cytotoxicity assays with IC50 values of 0.92 nM (95% CI: 0.23–3.6 nM) and 2.9 nM (95% CI: 1.4–5.8 nM), respectively. Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15. Gilteritinib treated mice showed significantly less widespread disease at day 42 than control counterparts (N=10, p<0.001) and significantly improved survival (log-rank, p<0.001).\n",

A BCR::NTRK2 fusion (ex1::ex17) was detected by comprehensive targeted tissue genomic profiling by NGS. NTRK2 protein kinase domain was retained (exons 17-21) in this fusion. Patient completed eight weeks of radiation therapy. However, there was evidence of recurrence. Entrectinib, an NTRK/ROS1/ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was initiated. After 33 weeks of therapy MRI showed decreased size of the recurrent lesion, and by the end of 15 months of therapy the patient remained asymptomatic. Later surveillance by MRI detected multiple sites of tumor enhancement. Authors suggest this case is the first case of adult GBM which showed successful but transitory use of entrectinib therapy.\n",

Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.

In this small study, EWSR::FLI1 type I fusion predominated over type II in localized Ewing's and were more abundant in tumors affecting the long bones (9 versus 0), however no correlations between different EWSR1 transcripts and any other clinical parameters could be identified.\n",
      "- ID 1753: The authors propose RT-PCR as a diagnostic test for Ewing sarcoma using FFPE materials.  Starting with 40 cases, intact RNA could be isolated from 6, and of these the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion was detected in 2 by nested PCR. Alternative diagnostic assays for this event are also considered.\n",
      "- ID 12003: In this 2018 study, the authors aimed to identify driver events in 'double negative' clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) where neither BCOR ITDs nor the YWHAE::NUTM2 gene fusion are detected. Eleven CCSK cases were included in the study, from pediatric patients aged 2 - 8 years. Using RT-PCR, BCOR exon 15 ITDs were detected in 10/11 cases, with only 1 case, an 8-year-old male, found to be a double negative. The case was identified to have a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion by a NanoString-based sarcoma fusion assay, with exon 15 of BCOR fused to exon 5 of CCNB3, confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. CCNB3 immunoreactivity was identified in the BCOR::CCNB3 case and not in the BCOR ITD CCSK cases tested. The authors conclude this is the first report of a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion detected in a CCSK of a young child, with the same fusion typically seen in primary bone and soft tissue sarcomas of male adolescents, and that other cases of double negative CCSK require characterization.\n",
      "- ID 12004: In this 2020 study, the authors report two patients with BCOR::CCNB3 fusion-positive clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). Cases were males aged 10 and 14 years who presented with advanced disease. With initial testing, both cases were negative for a BCOR ITD. However, RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing were able to detect a BCOR::CCNB3 gene fusion. The authors concluded that all reports of CCSK with a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion have been detected in males older than the typical age (<4 years of age) of presentation for CCSK, and recommend testing for the BCOR::CCNB3 fusion in CCSK patients lacking a BCOR ITD or YWHAE::NUTM2 gene fusion.\n",
      "- ID 12005: In this 2017 study, the authors describe two primary renal sarcomas harboring BCOR::CCNB3 gene fusions and compare the morphological and immunochemical features to typical clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK). The two tumors were diagnosed in males aged 11 and 12 years and were unclassified at diagnosis with overlapping features of CCSK and renal synovial sarcoma. The BCOR::CCNB3 gene fusion was detected by FISH in the two cases. Although these tumors were originally unclassified, with the molecular findings the cases were considered compatible with a CCSK diagnosis. The authors conclude there may be a “BCOR-alteration family” of renal and extra-renal neoplasms with overlapping clinicopathologic features.\n",
      "- ID 11539: A subset of renal neoplasms of children and young adults contains t(6;11)(p21;q12), fusion of the MALAT1 (Alpha) gene with the transcription factor gene TFEB. Argani, et al. (2005) included 7 renal neoplasms with cytogenetic and/or molecular evidence of the t(6;11)(p21;q12). The patients ranged from 9 to 33 years in age. All of the 7 renal neoplasms demonstrated either moderate or strong nuclear immunoreactivity for TFEB protein, and 1089 other neoplasms were tested but none showed significant labeling for TFEB. In 3 cases frozen tissue was available for RNA extraction, and RT-PCR detected the MALAT1(Alpha0::TFEB fusion. The potentially wide size range of MALAT1(Alpha)::TFEB fusion transcripts complicates the detection of this fusion by RT-PCR for robust detection in clinical RNA samples. The lack of splice signals in Alpha resulted in DNA PCR products of the same size as the RT-PCR products when the reverse primer binds to TFEB exon 3. The authors conclude that immunoreactivity for TFEB protein is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for these renal neoplasms and suggest that long-range DNA PCR may a useful alternative to RT-PCR due to the special molecular features of the Alpha::TFEB gene fusion.\n",
      "- ID 11535: Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) with t(6;11)(p21;q12) are extremely rare and are characterized by a specific chromosome translocation involving the transcription factor EB (TFEB). Identification of either overexpression of the TFEB protein or translocation is a useful method for the diagnosis of TFEB RCCs. However, the results of immunostainings can be inconsistent. This 2012 study included 7 genetically confirmed cases of this rare tumor. The patients’ ages ranged from 21 to 37 years.  All of these tumors showed moderate to strong immunoreactivity for TFEB. DNA PCR performed on genomic DNA extracted from FFPE tissue samples of the tumor identified the Alpha::TFEB fusion gene in 2 cases.  The TFEB partner gene MALAT1 (Alpha) is an intronless, untranslated (non-protein coding) gene of unknown function. The Alpha::TFEB fusion genes were not identified in the other 5 cases. Using a FISH split probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs showed a high percentage of cells with separation signals, and using a fusion probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs demonstrated fusion signals. They concluded that the diagnosis of such tumors should be based not only on morphology itself but also on immunophenotype and molecular genetic findings.\n",
      "- ID 11534: Bakouny, et al. (2022) performed a comprehensive study of the molecular and clinical features of translocation renal cell carcinomas (tRCCs), defined as subtype of kidney cancer driven by MiT/TFE gene fusions. Across the combined tRCC cohort, the majority of cases (78 cases; 88.6%) harbored TFE3 fusions, while the remainder harbored TFEB (8 cases; 9.1%) or MITF (2 cases; 2.3%) fusions.  Four different TFEB fusion partners were observed including CADM2, CLTC, COL21A1 and MALAT1. TFEB and MITF fusion partners tended to preserve less of the N-terminal fusion partner in the fusion product compared to TFE3. The authors conclude that most tRCCs harbor few somatic alterations apart from MiT/TFE fusions.\n",

This translocation, t(11;22)(q24; q12), results in the fusion of the EWSR1 gene's transactivation domain with the DNA binding domain of the FLI1 gene, creating a chimeric protein that drives oncogenesis. The presence of this specific fusion is pathognomonic for Ewing sarcoma, meaning it is a definitive diagnostic marker for the disease, which typically presents in pediatric and young adult populations.

The study included 13 tumors classified as pure SEF and six tumors from 4 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years. RNA-seq detected the EWSR1::CREB3L1 gene fusion in 8/13 pure SEF cases, with 2/13 positive for EWSR1::CREB3L2, and one each for FUS::CREM, FUS::CREB3L2, and PAX5::CREB3L1, while all hybrid tumors were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. SNP array showed both the pure SEF and hybrid tumors had multiple imbalances and structural rearrangements, and the authors suggest this could account for the poor outcome of SEF patients compared to LGFMS, which were found to be much less complex.\n",
      "- ID 12059: In this 2015 study, the authors aimed to further characterize the molecular characteristics of pure sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) and hybrid SEF/low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) lesions using FISH and/or RNA-Seq. A total of 18 cases included 10 cases of pure SEF and 8 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The overall mean age at diagnosis was 44 years (range 18–78). The pure SEF cases were found to have the well-known EWSR1::CREB3L1 fusion in 6/10 cases, a previously unidentified EWSR1::CREB3L2 fusion in 2/10 cases, a FUS rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10, and  an EWSR1 rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10 case.  On the other hand, the hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors all showed the presence of a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. The authors conclude identification of different fusions by gene-specific FISH probes can confirm differences underlying the histologically different pure SEF (mostly EWSR1 rearranged) from LGFMS variants (mainly FUS rearranged).\n",
      "- ID 12057: In this 2014 study, the authors compared 10 primary sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas (SEF), 4 cases of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), and one primary hybrid SEF/LGFMS. Patients with SEF ranged from 28 to 91 years of age. Using RT-PCR, they detected in-frame fusions in 3/4 cases with suitable samples, joining either exon 7, 8, or 11 of EWSR1 to exon 6 of CREB3L1. Split signals at EWSR1 and CREB3L1 were detected by FISH in an additional case. All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement. The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.\n",

Specimens were considered positive for fusion when FISH showed overlapping signals of HEY1 and NCOA2 in greater than 20% of the cells. Overlap signal of over 20% was seen in 8/10 patients. The two patients with no overlap signal were also negative for FISH staining, suggesting insufficient or damaged material for FISH.\n",

The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",
      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",

NTRK2 fusions were found in 4 of the 159 patients. Two cases NTRK2 fusion cases were shown to have reduction in tumor size with another tumor showing only minor growth.\n",

Dimer stability was modestly increased by S249C (-3.7 kcal/mol) versus wildtype FGFR3 (-3.4 kcal/mol). Intrinsic FRET demonstrated S249C dimers were significantly closer together (45 A) than the wildtype dimer (53 A). The substitution of cysteine was expected to lead to strong covalent bonds, but the authors conclude their data demonstrates S249C does not induce constitutive FGFR3 dimerization, but induces dimer structural modifications.\n",

Using a thymidine incorporation assay, S249C expressing cells were shown to lose contact inhibition and grew 3x to 4x more rapidly than controls. Soft agar assays demonstrated increased colony formation and anchorage independent growth in S249C expressing cells versus controls. All nude mice subcutaneously injected with S249C cells rapidly formed tumors, but no tumors were observed in empty vector injected mice.

Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop.

      "- ID 10361: An MRI of 26-year-old man presenting with motor weakness and language difficultly revealed a lesion in the left frontal lobe that extended across the corpus callosum. Histologic analysis of the biopsy characterized the lesion as a glioblastoma wildtype for IDH and was negative for EGFR and MET amplification based on FISH. The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response.\n",
      "- ID 10362: In a further investigation of non-traditional sarcoma cases, a 41-year-old man was thought to have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in the neck and spinal cord, but large rhabdoid/epithelioid cell morphology and retained H3K27Me3. Metastatic lesions were found in the lung and spine. Pan-TRK immunostain was positive and RNA NGS detected a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion. The authors state this is the first report of a KANK1::NTRK2 fusion in a sarcoma, which seems to forecast high-grade morphology and behavior.\n",
      "- ID 10896: From a retrospective review of 38,095 tumor samples from 33,997 patients that underwent fusion screening at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 87 tumors were found to be positive for an NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 fusion. One positive patient with Glioblastoma Multiforme had an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 (e11::e14) fusion that was not detected by MSK-IMPACT, but was found with the RNA Archer screen. Detection of this fusion was positive in the cytoplasm by Pan-Trk immunohistochemical staining.\n",
      "- ID 8653: A case report showing a two-year-old girl with an unusual pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) with both classic- and anaplastic- appearing tumors. A custom NGS panel identified a novel KANK1-NTRK2 fusion in both the classic and anaplastic regions. The KANK1-NTRK2 fusion was also detected in the resected recurrence, which was histologically similar to the initial anaplastic region. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, the most common genetic alteration in PA, was absent in this case. Different from previously known mechanisms underlying the progression to anaplastic PA, this case lacks NF1 alterations and is radiation-naïve.\n",
      "- ID 10360: An MRI in a previously healthy 6-year-old boy now presenting with neurologic abnormalities and seizers revealed a mass obstructing the foramen of Monro and diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. The primary tumor was resected and subsequent radiation therapy resulted in moderate cognitive and motor improvements. Seven months later, an MRI detected a recurrence, which led to tumor molecular profiling of patient DNA and RNA. RNA analysis discovered and confirmed an in-frame KANK1::NTRK2 e3::ex16 fusion, which was predicted to preserve NTRK2’s tyrosine kinase domain. The patient was started on larotrectinib and within 2 weeks demonstrated cognitive and motor improvements. After 2 months of therapy, an MRI showed significant tumor response and by 4 months cognition and memory were near-baseline. Overall, larotrectinib resulted in both sustained clinical and radiographic response through 10 months of treatment with no related toxicity.\n",

Patient had the BCR::NTRK2 fusion. Treatment duration at data cutoff was 2.5 months. The patient showed stable disease as response.\n",
      "- ID 12035: A 67-year-old male with a diagnosis of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), IDH-wildtype, WHO grade 4 underwent a craniotomy with gross total resection. A BCR::NTRK2 fusion (ex1::ex17) was detected by comprehensive targeted tissue genomic profiling by NGS. NTRK2 protein kinase domain was retained (exons 17-21) in this fusion. Patient completed eight weeks of radiation therapy. However, there was evidence of recurrence. Entrectinib, an NTRK/ROS1/ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was initiated. After 33 weeks of therapy MRI showed decreased size of the recurrent lesion, and by the end of 15 months of therapy the patient remained asymptomatic. Later surveillance by MRI detected multiple sites of tumor enhancement. Authors suggest this case is the first case of adult GBM which showed successful but transitory use of entrectinib therapy.\n",

Molecular alterations were detected in 31/32 (97%) of LGNTs with an astrocytic morphology, including 17 diffuse astrocytomas and 15 angiocentric gliomas, and no IDH mutations were detected in these tumors. MYB (n=5) or MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangement fusions were detected in 41% (7/17) of diffuse astrocytomas, while the remaining tumors had alternations involving BRAF (n = 4), FGFR1/3 (n = 4), and others (n = 2). The gene partners involving MYB fusions in diffuse astrocytomas included PCDHGA1, LOC154902, and MMP16 and the gene parterners involivng MYBL included MMP16. In contrast, a MYB fusion (most frequently MYB::QKI) characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (14–15). Only one other tumor across the series (an oligodendroglioma) had a MYB fusion (MYB::MAML2). MYB/MYBL-altered LGNTs clustered together with methylation profiling. The findings in LGNT with a predominantly astrocytic phenotype associating with MYB/MYBL alterations suggest a role of MYB/MYBL in these tumor categories with distinct characteristics.\n",
      "- ID 11778: The study compiled the clinicopathologic and molecular features of 46 gliomas with a MYB or MYBL1 alteration diagnosed at a single center. The tumors showed low-grade histopathologic features and were broadly classified as diffuse astrocytoma (n = 11) or angiocentric glioma (n=35). Molecular alterations interrogated by immunohistochemistry (n=46), RNA sequencing (n=29), FISH (n=24), or PCR-based sequencing (n=11) revealed MYB (n=44) or MYBL1 (n=2) alterations in all tumors. None had alterations in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, ATRX, or histone H3 genes. Regardless of histopathologic diagnosis or anatomic location, DNA methylome profiling on 35 MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas formed a single cluster, supporting that MYB/MYBL1-altered gliomas represent a single disease entity with a range of clinical and pathologic characteristics. Of the 11 diffuse astrocytomas with MYB (n=9) and MYBL1 (n=2) rearrangements, 9 had identified gene partners, including PCDHGA1 (n=5), LOC154902 (n=1), MMP16 (n=1), and MAML2 (n=1) with MYB and MMP16 (n=1) with MYBL1.\n",
      "- ID 11790: A research study performed in 2010 involved 57 pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and a comparison group of 59 pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Among the LGG group, there were 34 cases of pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) and 23 cases of diffuse gliomas, which included fibrillary astrocytomas (DA, n=14), oligodendroglial tumors (n=7), and angiocentric gliomas (AG, n=2). The study utilized SNP arrays and FISH to detect MYB rearrangements and quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IMHC) to analyze MYB expression levels. Gains involving MYB and MYB amplifications that upregulate MYB RNA and protein expression were demonstrated in 2/14 diffuse astrocytomas (DAs). No MYB fusions were detected in the two DAs, but the sequence from one DA was found to terminate within MYB exon 9. In addition, the study revealed increased MYB expression in both AGs, with one AG showing a focal deletion in the 3' terminal region of MYB. Overall, increased MYB expression by RT-PCR was seen in 8 LGGs, including 5 DAs, 2 AGs, and 1 oligodendroglioma, and in all three cases with MYB copy number aberrations. IMHC revealed an increase in MYB expression at the protein level in 60% of LGGs including 41% of PAs, and 19% of HGGs. Notably, genomic abnormalities were exclusively observed in diffuse gliomas. The findings suggest that MYB dysregulation may contribute to pediatric gliomas, particularly in diffuse gliomas, through various mechanisms beyond amplification and deletion.\n",
      "- ID 11776: Histological, molecular, and clinical analysis of 26 histologically prototypical isomorphic diffuse gliomas with a specific DNA methylation profile distinct from other glial/glio-neuronal brain tumors and normal hemispheric tissue were found to be most closely related to pediatric MYB/MYBL1-altered diffuse astrocytomas and angiocentric gliomas. IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing data demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Three tumors had MYB fusions with the gene partners, including HMG20A (n=1) and PCDHGA1 (n=2). These gene fusions resulted in a deletion of the C-terminal negative regulatory C-myb domain and/or a loss of the negative regulatory 3' miRNA-binding sites with an associated increase in MYB expression. Copy number analysis revealed gain or loss involving MYB in 3 tumors, including one tumor with gains involving both MYB and HMG20A resulting in two different MYB::HMG20A fusions and two tumors without MYB fusions detected. Increased MYB expression was observed in four (4/6) tumors\n",
      "- ID 12009: RNA sequencing identified NUTM1 fusions in six patients with primary undifferentiated soft tissue and visceral tumors.  Fusions included BRD4::NUTM1 (three cases), BRD3::NUTM1, MXD1::NUTM1, and BCORL1::NUTM1, however only the BRD4::NUTM1 and BRD3::NUTM1 cases were positive for NUTM1 IHC.   Independent testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of the NUTM1 and partner gene rearrangement.  The breakpoints were located at NUTM1 exon 3 or 5 (NM_001284292.1) and BRD4 exon 11 (NM_058243.2) or BRD3 exon 9 (NM_007371.3). Despite some overlap with NUT midline carcinoma, the authors note that the tumors observed also differed in several ways, tentatively labeled these malignant neoplasms as \"NUT-associated tumors\", and speculate that they might represent an overarching category that also includes NUT midline carcinoma.\n",
      "- ID 12050: In this 2020 study, the authors included a total of 141 NUT carcinomas defined by rearrangement of NUTM1 detected by IHC, cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The median age at diagnosis was 24 years (range of 18 days to 80 years). Fusion partners were confirmed by either cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The majority  (78%) of tumors harbored a BRD4::NUTM1 fusion, 15% harbored a BRD3::NUTM1  fusion, 6% harbored a NSD3::NUTM1 fusion, 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF532::NUTM1 fusion and 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF592::NUTM1 fusion. For the remaining 14 cases the fusion partner gene to NUTM1 was not identified. The majority of tumors arose from the thorax or head and neck, but tumors were also seen in bone, soft tissue, and kidney. Outcomes in patients were overall poor, however, the authors conclude that they have identified three clinically and molecularly defined prognostic risk groups: group A is nonthoracic, BRD3::NUTM1, or NSD3::NUTM1 with a significantly improved prognosis (OS of 36.5 months); group B is nonthoracic, BRD4::NUTM1 with a poor prognosis (OS of 10 months); and group C is thoracic with a very poor prognosis (OS of 3.5 to 5.6 months) regardless of the NUTM1 fusion partner.\n",
      "- ID 12049: In this 2017 study, the authors sought to characterize NUT carcinomas. They included a cohort of 12 aggressive malignant tumors with rearrangement of the NUTM1 gene, assessed by RT-PCR, FISH, positive nuclear NUTM1 immunohistochemistry, and/or t(15; 19) detection by cytogenetics. The median age at onset was 18 years (with a range of 12 –50 years). RT-PCR or FISH confirmed the fusion partner as BRD4 in 9 of 12 cases, and a finding of t(15;19) (q13;p13) by cytogenetics confirmed BRD4 as the partner in 1 case.  All cases tested had positive anti-NUTM1 antibody immunostaining. The primary tumor was found to be lateralized in two-thirds of the cases, rather than localized to the midline, supporting the change in name from \"NUT midline carcinoma\" to \"NUT carcinoma\". The authors state that 50% of cases initially had an alternative diagnosis and recommend NUTM1-specific antibody immunostaining in cases of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinoma to properly diagnose NUT carcinoma at an earlier stage.\n",
      "- ID 12051: In this 2004 study, the authors sought to identify carcinomas with translocation t(15;19)(q13, p13.1), which results in the novel oncogenic fusion BRD4::NUTM1 (described as NUT). The authors screened malignant tumors with epithelial differentiation, in patients less than 40 years of age, with poorly differentiated histomorphology, rapid clinical progression, and/or cytogenetic evidence of chromosome 15q or 19p rearrangement. In total, using FISH with dual-color assays evaluating chromosome 19p13.1 BRD4 and 15q13 NUTM1 breakpoints, they detected 11 tumors to have a NUTM1 rearrangement, with 7 of the cases detected in 98 previously unscreened samples and the others in known positive cases. Patients with a NUTM1 rearrangement ranged from 3 to 35 years of age. The NUTM1 rearrangement was consistent with BRD4::NUTM1 in 8/11 cases and 3/11 were found to have a rearrangement of NUTM1 but not BRD4, suggesting the existence of other rearrangements involving NUTM1 which the authors designate NUT-variant carcinomas. The authors conclude that NUTM1 rearranged carcinomas can arise from various midline epithelial surfaces and are associated with poor outcome.\n",
      "- ID 12060: In this 2014 study, the authors compared 10 primary sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas (SEF), 4 cases of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS), and one primary hybrid SEF/LGFMS. Patients with LGFMS ranged from 22 to 53 years of age.  All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement.  EWSR1::CREB3L1 was detected in SEF.  The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF while FUS::CREB3L2 is common in LGFMS, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types.\n",
      "- ID 12062: In this study, an RT-PCR assay detected a FUS::CREB3L2 transcript in 14 of 16 (88%) low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) cases, whereas the fusion was not detected in any of the 123 other soft-tissue tumors (including desmoid-type fibromatoses, myxofibrosarcomas, soft-tissue perineuriomas, and congenital or adult fibrosarcomas). Patients ages ranged from 13 to 58 years. The fusion product involved exon 6 of FUS and exon 5 of CREB3L2 in the majority of cases. This supports FUS::CREB3L2 detection as a reliable approach to accurately diagnose LGFMS.\n",
      "- ID 12061: RT-PCR analysis of 59 low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas (LGFMS) and 52 non-LGFMS tumors selected for their resemblance to LGFMS (LGFMS-like tumors), identified a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion in 45 cases, a FUS::CREB3L1 in 3 cases, and no fusion in 11 cases of LGFMS. FUS exon 6 and CREB3L2 exon 5 were most frequently rearranged. Median age at LGFMS diagnosis was 35 years (range 11 to 75 years). 7 of 52 non-LGMFS neoplasms contained a FUS-CREB3L2 fusion with 4 of these diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, a sarcoma known to have molecular and morphological overlap with LGMFS.  The presence of these FUS fusions and the histology may be helpful in diagnosis.\n",

      "- ID 11527: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of 323 tumors with an institutional diagnosis of primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-PNETs) has identified four novel methylation profiles. One of those profiles included CNS neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (CNS NB-FOXR2) which was seen in 14% (44/323) of the tumors. Genome-wide sequencing detected gene rearrangements involving the full-length coding sequence of FOXR2 with fusion partners JMJD1C, LOC550643, JPX, MAGEH1, or MAGED2 that resulted in high expression of FOXR2. The authors proposed that CNS NB-FOXR2 defines a specific molecular subtype of CNS neuroblastoma tumors.\n",
      "- ID 11528: DNA methylation profiling of 84 CNS-PNET tumors identified four molecular groups of CNS-PNET. One of the molecular group was CNS neuroblastoma with forkhead box R2 (FOXR2) activation (CNS_NBL) which was presented in 20 cases (24%). RNA sequencing of 14 CNS_NBL tumors detected gene fusion transcripts involving the FOXR2 gene and fusion partners, FOXR2 (Xp11.21; intergenic duplication involving FOXR2 coding sequence [CDS]), LINC00486 (2p22), TM7SF3 (12p11.23), and FRMD4A (10p11.3). All 14 CNS_NBL tumors showed high level of FOXR2 gene expression.\n",
      "- ID 12009: RNA sequencing identified NUTM1 fusions in six patients with primary undifferentiated soft tissue and visceral tumors.  Fusions included BRD4::NUTM1 (three cases), BRD3::NUTM1, MXD1::NUTM1, and BCORL1::NUTM1, however only the BRD4::NUTM1 and BRD3::NUTM1 cases were positive for NUTM1 IHC.   Independent testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of the NUTM1 and partner gene rearrangement.  The breakpoints were located at NUTM1 exon 3 or 5 (NM_001284292.1) and BRD4 exon 11 (NM_058243.2) or BRD3 exon 9 (NM_007371.3). Despite some overlap with NUT midline carcinoma, the authors note that the tumors observed also differed in several ways, tentatively labeled these malignant neoplasms as \"NUT-associated tumors\", and speculate that they might represent an overarching category that also includes NUT midline carcinoma.\n",
      "- ID 12050: In this 2020 study, the authors included a total of 141 NUT carcinomas defined by rearrangement of NUTM1 detected by IHC, cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The median age at diagnosis was 24 years (range of 18 days to 80 years). Fusion partners were confirmed by either cytogenetics, FISH or sequencing. The majority  (78%) of tumors harbored a BRD4::NUTM1 fusion, 15% harbored a BRD3::NUTM1  fusion, 6% harbored a NSD3::NUTM1 fusion, 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF532::NUTM1 fusion and 1 of 141 harbored a ZNF592::NUTM1 fusion. For the remaining 14 cases the fusion partner gene to NUTM1 was not identified. The majority of tumors arose from the thorax or head and neck, but tumors were also seen in bone, soft tissue, and kidney. Outcomes in patients were overall poor, however, the authors conclude that they have identified three clinically and molecularly defined prognostic risk groups: group A is nonthoracic, BRD3::NUTM1, or NSD3::NUTM1 with a significantly improved prognosis (OS of 36.5 months); group B is nonthoracic, BRD4::NUTM1 with a poor prognosis (OS of 10 months); and group C is thoracic with a very poor prognosis (OS of 3.5 to 5.6 months) regardless of the NUTM1 fusion partner.\n",
      "- ID 12049: In this 2017 study, the authors sought to characterize NUT carcinomas. They included a cohort of 12 aggressive malignant tumors with rearrangement of the NUTM1 gene, assessed by RT-PCR, FISH, positive nuclear NUTM1 immunohistochemistry, and/or t(15; 19) detection by cytogenetics. The median age at onset was 18 years (with a range of 12 –50 years). RT-PCR or FISH confirmed the fusion partner as BRD4 in 9 of 12 cases, and a finding of t(15;19) (q13;p13) by cytogenetics confirmed BRD4 as the partner in 1 case.  All cases tested had positive anti-NUTM1 antibody immunostaining. The primary tumor was found to be lateralized in two-thirds of the cases, rather than localized to the midline, supporting the change in name from \"NUT midline carcinoma\" to \"NUT carcinoma\". The authors state that 50% of cases initially had an alternative diagnosis and recommend NUTM1-specific antibody immunostaining in cases of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinoma to properly diagnose NUT carcinoma at an earlier stage.\n",
      "- ID 12051: In this 2004 study, the authors sought to identify carcinomas with translocation t(15;19)(q13, p13.1), which results in the novel oncogenic fusion BRD4::NUTM1 (described as NUT). The authors screened malignant tumors with epithelial differentiation, in patients less than 40 years of age, with poorly differentiated histomorphology, rapid clinical progression, and/or cytogenetic evidence of chromosome 15q or 19p rearrangement. In total, using FISH with dual-color assays evaluating chromosome 19p13.1 BRD4 and 15q13 NUTM1 breakpoints, they detected 11 tumors to have a NUTM1 rearrangement, with 7 of the cases detected in 98 previously unscreened samples and the others in known positive cases. Patients with a NUTM1 rearrangement ranged from 3 to 35 years of age. The NUTM1 rearrangement was consistent with BRD4::NUTM1 in 8/11 cases and 3/11 were found to have a rearrangement of NUTM1 but not BRD4, suggesting the existence of other rearrangements involving NUTM1 which the authors designate NUT-variant carcinomas. The authors conclude that NUTM1 rearranged carcinomas can arise from various midline epithelial surfaces and are associated with poor outcome.\n",
      "- ID 1282: In this Phase II trial of 87 patients (NCT01871805), alectinib was assayed for safety and efficacy in ALK positive NSCLC that had progressed on crizotinib. Of 69 patients with measurable disease, 35 achieved objective response, with median duration of response 13.5 months. Of 16 patients with measurable CNS disease, four achieved CNS complete response and 8 showed CNS partial response. median duration of CNS response was 11.1 months. 2 deaths were observed, and 1 was judged related to study treatment.\n",
      "- ID 7284: In a phase 3 trial, 303 patients with NSCLC with ALK fusion were randomly assigned to alectinib arm (N=152) or crizotinib arm (N=151). PFS was significantly longer with alectinib than with crizotinib (HR for disease progression or death 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34-0.65, p<0.001). Investigator-assessed RR was 82.9% in alectinib arm and 75.5% in crizotinib arm. CNS RR in patients with measurable CNS lesions was 81% and 50% for alectinib and crizotinib, respectively. Eight patients in the alectinib group, in comparison to one patient with crizotinib, had a complete CNS response. Despite longer treatment duration for alectinib, there were fewer grade 3-5 adverse events compared with crizotinib treatment.\n",
      "- ID 1273: In this case study of a critically ill 29 year old male nonsmoker with advanced metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC, alectinib (CH5424802), was administered as first line treatment. Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.\n",
      "- ID 1272: In this initial report of a single-arm Phase I and II study (JapicCTI-101264) of alectinib (CH5424802), 46 patients with advanced or metastatic ALK-rearranged non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were assessed for objective response during phase II. ALK positivity was assessed via IHC and verified with FISH or RT-PCR. Patients had received one or more rounds of previous chemotherapy, but no prior targeted therapy towards ALK. From the 46 patients, 41 showed partial response, and 2 showed complete response. CNS metastases in three patients which had not received prior brain irradiation showed response to alectinib. Alectinib was generally well tolerated, and the authors conclude that alectinib compared favorably to crizotinib and could be an effective and safe option in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\n",
      "- ID 1279: In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.\n",
      "- ID 8657: A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).\n",

The film's editors also reportedly altered the score's chronological flow, sometimes looping, truncating or removing the music and placing it in fragmented form in the film out of context.

      "- ID 80: The Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame is a collection of plaques, mounted on a brick wall in the Ashburn Alley section of Citizens Bank Park, the ballpark of the Philadelphia Phillies.  From 1978 to 2003, the Phillies inducted one figure from their franchise history and one notable person from the Philadelphia Athletics (A's) organization each year—with the exception of 1983, when the Phillies inducted their Centennial Team.  Once Veterans Stadium closed in 2003, the wall plaques used to recognize the Phillies' members were moved to Citizens Bank Park; however, the Phillies no longer induct notable Athletics.  Each person inducted into the Wall of Fame was honored with a metal plaque showing the person's face; their position with, and years of service to, the team; and a summary of their most important contributions.  In March 2004, the Athletics' plaques were relocated to the Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, and a single plaque listing all of the A's inductees was attached to a statue of Connie Mack located across the street from Citizens Bank Park.\n",

The monorail system is located in a former auto repair shop along an alley between East Broadway Avenue and East Briggs Avenue.  It is the rear, single-story, portion of the building at 117 E. Broadway Ave where the system is located.  The storefront portion of the building, also historically associated with the automobile industry, is a two-story brick building built on a stone foundation.  The east side of the central business district in Fairfield had become the center for automobile related businesses by the 1920s.  Harley Carter bought this building in 1920, and had the monorail system, manufactured by the Louden Machinery Company, installed about 1922.  The overhead material handling system is permanently attached to the east wall of the shop.  It allowed the mechanics to more easily move the heavy engines and other parts to and from vehicles.  The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.\n",

      "- ID 109: The York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England.  Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial.  Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose.  Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument.  The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York.  Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials.  Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's.  Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.  This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.\n",
      "- ID 110: Spalding War Memorial is a First World War memorial in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall (pronounced ) in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in eastern England.  It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.  The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war.  She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross.  The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council.  When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested.  After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building.\n",
      "- ID 111: The Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire.  The statue was named after the Battle of Maiwand and was erected in 1884 to commemorate the deaths of 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot during the campaign in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan between 1878 and 1880.  It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion.\n",
      "- ID 112: Kargil War Memorial, also known as the Vijaypath, is a war memorial built by the Indian Army, located in Dras, in the foothills of the Tololing Hill.  The memorial is located about 5 km from the city centre across the Tiger Hill.  It is located on the Srinagar-Leh National Highway 1D.  The memorial is in the memory of the soldiers and officers of the Indian Army who were killed during the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan.  The conflict later became known as the \"Kargil War\".  The memorial has a huge epitaph with names of all the officers and soldiers who died in war.  Kargil Vijay Diwas is celebrated on 26 July every year at the memorial simultaneously the Prime Minister of India pays tribute to the soldiers at Amar Jawan Jyothi at the India Gate, New Delhi. The main attraction of the whole memorial is the Sandstone wall, in the open, which has the names of all the Indian army personnel, who laid their lives during the Kargil war besides there is also a souvenir shop.  Visitors to the memorial can also see from there, some of the peaks that the Indian army captured back from Pakistan.  A giant national flag, weighing 15 kg was hoisted at the Kargil war memorial to commemorate the 13th anniversary of India’s victory in the war\n",
      "- ID 113: Manchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square in Manchester, England.  Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities—the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922.  The committee quickly raised £10,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial.  The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community.  The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church.  Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ.\n",
      "- ID 114: Forbury Gardens is a public park in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.  The park is on the site of the outer court of Reading Abbey, which was in front of the Abbey Church.

Fairs were held on the site three times a year until the 19th century.\n",
      "- ID 115: The Devon County War Memorial is a First World War memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and situated on the cathedral green in Exeter, the county town of Devon, in the south west of England.  It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city.  The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds.  After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead.  The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations.  A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials—the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens.\n",

The historical record is incomplete and the kingdom was probably not a continuous entity throughout the entire period.

At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney.

He was a son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle.  Aonghus Mór appears to have succeeded his father in the mid part of the thirteenth century.  At the time, the rulers of the Isles were fiercely independent of the Scottish Crown, and owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown.  Aonghus Mór's first certain appearance in the historical record seems to evince his involvement in aiding native Irish kindreds against the consolidation of Anglo-Irish authority in the north-west Ireland.  Such cooperation could have been undertaken in the context of overseas kindreds like Clann Domhnaill constructing Irish alliances to gain assistance against Scottish encroachment.\n",

The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, although only some of the later rulers claimed that title.  At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney.  At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory.  The islands involved have a total land area of over 8300 km2 and extend for more than 500 km from north to south.\n",

      "- ID 139: Maxine's Tap Room is a historic bar in Fayetteville, Arkansas, located on 107 N. Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas.  Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents.  She managed to pay her parents back within the year.  In 1960 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building—a long, narrow brick structure—built in its place.  The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 in by 40 in , in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time.  This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins.  Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success.  Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50 ft -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie.  Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000.  She died at age 82 in May 2006.  A month later the Tap Room caught fire.  Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007.  Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar.  The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through.  Considerable efforts were made to retain many things that had been in the bar for a very long time, such as the older lights and signs.\n",

      "\n",
      "Evidence List:\n",
      "- ID 148: Chronic Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma.  These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma.  Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood.  These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV).  Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age.  HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development.  In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma.  Thus, \"Chlamydia pneumoniae\", \"Mycoplasma pneumoniae\" and human rhinoviruses are microbes that play a major role in non-atopic asthma.\n",

The symptoms of respiratory reactions in this syndrome are hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs rather than the typically described true allergic reactions that trigger other common allergen-induced asthma, rhinitis, or hives.  The NSAID-induced reactions do not appear to involve the common mediators of true allergic reactions, immunoglobulin E or T cells.  Rather, AERD is a type of NSAID-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.
