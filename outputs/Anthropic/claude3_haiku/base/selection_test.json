The evidence shows that patients with ETV6-NTRK3 fusion-positive cancers, including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), have demonstrated significant clinical benefit and tumor regression when treated with the TRK inhibitor larotrectinib. Specifically, the evidence indicates that in both in vivo and in vitro models, larotrectinib was highly effective against cells harboring the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion (IDs 6930, 8931). Additionally, case reports of B-ALL patients with the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion showed rapid and durable responses to larotrectinib treatment, including complete remission of leukemia in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and central nervous system (IDs 7993, 8917). In contrast, the evidence does not directly support Claim B regarding the role of the PAX5 p.P80R mutation as an essential diagnostic criterion for a specific B-ALL subtype. While the PAX5 p.P80R mutation may be associated with certain B-ALL cases, the available information does not indicate that it is required for the diagnosis of the proposed \"B-lymphoblastic leukaemia with PAX5 p.P80R\" subtype. Therefore, the evidence more strongly supports Claim A that ETV6-NTRK3\u2013positive B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia patients can be sensitive to larotrectinib, as demonstrated by the robust clinical responses observed in this patient population."

Specifically, in vitro studies have shown that EGFR L858R-expressing cell lines have low IC50 values for erlotinib, indicating high sensitivity (Evidence IDs 3811, 4285, 4291). Additionally, clinical trials have reported median progression-free survival of 9.7 months with erlotinib versus 5.2 months with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with EGFR L858R mutations (Evidence ID 885).
