    "generated_explanation": "The claim that ETV6::NTRK3 is a desirable diagnostic criterion for congenital (infantile) fibrosarcoma is supported by evidence showing a high prevalence of this fusion in affected cases. Specifically, one study found that 91% of congenital fibrosarcoma cases tested positive for the ETV6::NTRK3 fusion, while it was absent in a wide range of other spindle cell tumors, indicating strong specificity. Another study corroborated this finding with a 70% positivity rate in congenital fibrosarcomas, further demonstrating the fusion's utility in diagnosis. However, caution is warranted due to the relatively small sample sizes and the need for further validation in larger cohorts to ensure the robustness of these findings."
