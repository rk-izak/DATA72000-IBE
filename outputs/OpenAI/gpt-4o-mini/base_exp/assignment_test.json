      "generated_explanation": "FOXR2 activation has been consistently observed in a significant proportion of CNS neuroblastoma cases, suggesting a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. Studies indicate that structural rearrangements leading to FOXR2 activation correlate with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis, reinforcing its utility as a diagnostic marker. The presence of FOXR2-activated neuroblastoma not only aids in distinguishing this subtype from other CNS tumors but also provides insights into potential therapeutic targets, thereby highlighting its significance in clinical practice."

      "generated_explanation": "The identification of NUTM1 fusion in tumor samples has emerged as a hallmark of NUT carcinoma, with studies demonstrating its presence in nearly all cases. This genetic alteration is crucial for the diagnosis, as it differentiates NUT carcinoma from other poorly differentiated neoplasms, which can often be misclassified. Furthermore, the NUTM1 fusion is associated with specific clinical features and aggressive behavior, underscoring its relevance in understanding the molecular profile of the disease and guiding treatment strategies."
