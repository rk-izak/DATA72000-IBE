      "generated_explanation": "NUTM1 fusion is a crucial diagnostic criterion for NUT carcinoma, as indicated by the presence of NUTM1 fusions in patients with primary undifferentiated soft tissue and visceral tumors. The identification of NUTM1 fusions, including BRD4::NUTM1 and BRD3::NUTM1, confirms the importance of NUTM1 fusion as a defining molecular feature of NUT carcinoma."
