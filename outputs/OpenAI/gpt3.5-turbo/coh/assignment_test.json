Response rates in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients to crizotinib were higher in specific EML4-ALK variants, demonstrating sensitivity to targeted therapy. The impact of ALK inhibitor TAE684 and crizotinib on ALK fusion cancer drivers further supports the sensitivity of ALK fusion positive NSCLC to alectinib.
