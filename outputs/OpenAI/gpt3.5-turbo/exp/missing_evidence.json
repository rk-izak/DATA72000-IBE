    "generated_explanation": "The presence of HER2 amplification in breast cancers, particularly in cases with ERBB2 amplification, indicates a potential sensitivity to Trastuzumab due to the overexpression of the HER2 protein. Clinical success with Trastuzumab in treating HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer further supports this claim. However, the emergence of resistance, as seen in some cases requiring tyrosine kinase inhibitors like Lapatinib, suggests that not all HER2-amplified cancers may respond to Trastuzumab alone. Despite this, the overall evidence strongly favors the notion that HER2 amplification predicts sensitivity to Trastuzumab, with considerations for potential resistance and alternative treatment options."
