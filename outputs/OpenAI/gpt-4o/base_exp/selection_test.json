  {
    "selected_claim": "A",
    "generated_explanation": "The evidence strongly supports Claim A, as EGFR L858R mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are well-documented to respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors like afatinib. Clinical studies and molecular profiling consistently show that patients with this mutation exhibit significant sensitivity to afatinib, leading to improved outcomes. In contrast, while SNX2-ABL1 fusions are associated with Ph-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia, the evidence for this association is less robust and not as extensively validated as the relationship between EGFR L858R mutations and afatinib sensitivity. Therefore, Claim A has superior explanatory power based on the current evidence and background knowledge."
