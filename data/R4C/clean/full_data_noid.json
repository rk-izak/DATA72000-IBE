His debut album, 21 & Up was released on August 25, 2009.  The Ridgeway native was 16 when he made his professional foray into the music business.  Inspired by New Orleans\u2019 innovative Cash Money Crew, Ru began making a name for himself on his local music scene, doing live shows and pressing up his own CDs.  His hard-hitting lyrics and entrepreneurial spirit caught the attention of fellow South Carolinian Angie Stone.  Shortly after the neo-soul songstress helped him secure a deal with Elektra Records, Ru found himself unsigned again, among the artists lost in the shuffle after the label merged with Atlantic Records.  Music fans first heard him on his 2001 debut single Will Destroy.  He then released his 2002 follow up, Shawty What You Doin\u2019.  Both songs reached the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop charts and helped land him at his next label home, Capitol Records."

The sexual relationship took place between 1995 and 1996 and came to light in 1998.  Clinton ended a televised speech with the statement that he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky.  Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives.  He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial.  Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright.  His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court."

Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial.  Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose.  Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument.  The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York.  Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials.  Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's.  Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.  This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds."

The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war.  She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross.  The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council.  When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested.  After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building."

        "description": "Maxine's Tap Room is a historic bar in Fayetteville, Arkansas, located on 107 N. Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas.  Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents.  She managed to pay her parents back within the year.  In 1960 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building\u2014a long, narrow brick structure\u2014built in its place.  The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 in by 40 in , in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time.  This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins.  Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success.  Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50 ft -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie.  Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000.  She died at age 82 in May 2006.  A month later the Tap Room caught fire.  Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007.  Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar.  The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through.  Considerable efforts were made to retain many things that had been in the bar for a very long time, such as the older lights and signs."

        "description": "Chronic Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma.  These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma.  Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood.  These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV).  Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age.  HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development.  In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma.  Thus, \"Chlamydia pneumoniae\", \"Mycoplasma pneumoniae\" and human rhinoviruses are microbes that play a major role in non-atopic asthma."

Members of the bands are or have been affiliated with The Hope Conspiracy, Death By Stereo, When Tigers Fight, Adamantium, Give Up the Ghost/American Nightmare, Clouds, Panic and many more.  Most of these are bands with whom Alexander has drummed for short periods of time.  Dave Weinberg was also known for his frequent collaborations and duets with Julie Ecker and James \"Boom Boom\" Auclair (cf. unpublished correspondence with the artists).  Despite their short tenure, The Suicide File continues to be revered within the hardcore punk community for their musical output and lasting impression on the flourishing Boston hardcore scene.  The band since 2006 has played a small number of successfully sized reunion sets."

In 1999, John Zandig and five of his students, Ric Blade, T.C.K, Lobo, Nick Gage, and Justice Pain (along with trainer Jon Dahmer) began to run professional wrestling shows in New Jersey and Delaware, showcasing a brand of hardcore wrestling dubbed as \"ultraviolence\".  Ladders, tables, steel folding chairs, thumbtacks, barbed wire, weed whackers, light tubes, panes of glass, and fire are all common elements of \"ultraviolent wrestling\" in CZW.  The company filled a niche for hardcore wrestling fans that had been left open by the folding of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW).  CZW established themselves as the leading American hardcore wrestling promotion at the ECW Arena with their \"Cage of Death 3\" show in 2001, the year ECW folded."

        "description": "Dinosaur behavior is difficult for paleontologists to study since much of paleontology is dependent solely on the physical remains of ancient life.  However, trace fossils and paleopathology can give insight into dinosaur behavior.  Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their habitat, computer simulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches.  As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future.  However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs.  Gregarious behavior was common in many dinosaur species.  Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for their young.  There is evidence that many types of dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals.  Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles.  The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the marginocephalians, theropods and lambeosaurines, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism.  Most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion.  A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, in particular, has provided significant insight in this area.  For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float."

Those who arrived in Kerala and Gujarat for trading goods were later recruited to the army.  Most Arabs were traders, and businessmen who sold or traded silk, diamonds and other valuables resulting in wealthy business men.  The city of Surat and villages within the city are known for Arab settlements.  Variav and Randev are the few villages that Arabs started their lives in.  In Hyderabad, Chaush are Arab community of Hadhrami descent whose ancestors were recruited as soldier by Nizam of Hyderabad.  In coastal Karnataka, Iraqis arrived during the reign of Tipu Sultan.  They claim their ancestry from Banu Assad.  These population migrations may have been favored by both the Nizam of Hyderabad and Tipu Sultan of Mysore because both had their ancestral linkages to these populations.The Asaf Jahi Dynasty claimed Arab ancestry from Asir Province and Tipu Sultan from the Bani Hashim of Hijaz Province in Arabia.  Many Arabs having Adnani ancestry such as Quraishi, Ansari, Sayyid tribes and other descendants of the Sahaba were employed by the Princely States in their military as they were found efficient during warfare.  In Kerala, Syed Thangals of Hadhrami descent settled around 17th century as missionaries to propagate Islam.  There are also Shia Sayyids in Northern region of country who claim descent from Wasit, Iraq like Zaidis although many Arab genealogists dispute this fact.  Sunni Sayyid of the country also claim Arab descent from Sufi missionaries.  Most of the Sufis migrated from Persia.  Sunni Sayyids claim their Arab ancestry through Imam Hassan or Imam Hussain in which case their names may be Hassani, Hussaini or Hashmi.  Some also claim descent from both and are termed \"\"Najeeb AlTarfayn\"\" or \"Noble on both sides\".  Many Sufi Saints such as Abdul-Qadir Gilani and Moinuddin Chishti and their descendants claim themselves as \"Najeeb AlTarfayn\" although many genealogists dispute this fact.

They don't know their tribe but trace lineage from Umar - Farooqi, Abu Bakr- Siddiqui, Uthman - Usmani and Ali - Alawi or Mir, who established the Rashidun Caliphate.

He appointed Henry Briggs as the first professor.  Edward Titchmarsh (professor 1931\u201363) said when applying that he was not prepared to lecture on geometry, and the requirement was removed from the duties of the post to enable his appointment, although the title of the chair was not changed.  The two Savilian chairs have been linked with professorial fellowships at New College, Oxford since the late 19th century.  Before then, for over 175 years until the middle of the 19th century, the geometry professors had an official residence adjoining the college in New College Lane."

The canal opened up huge new tracts of land to agriculture, especially to cotton monoculture heavily promoted by the Soviet Union, and supplying Ashgabat with a major source of water.  Unfortunately, the primitive construction of the canal allows almost 50\u00a0percent of the water to escape en route, creating lakes and ponds along the canal, and a rise in groundwater leading to widespread soil salinization problems.  The canal is also a major factor leading to the Aral Sea environmental disaster."

        "description": "The hill rises about 250 feet above the level of the plateau, which itself constitutes the summit of the Mahadev range at this point.  The cone with the walls on it is seen from a great distance and appears very small indeed.  But on near approach it is seen to be but the inner citadel of a place of considerable size and strength for the times in which it was built.  On the south-west the outer wall or enceinte is entered by a rude gateway of a single pointed arch about eight feet high and five feet broad.  As usual there is a curtain of solid masonry inside.  The gate lies about 150 yards east of the edge of the plateau, which there terminates in an almost unbroken vertical precipice of several hundred feet in height and receding in a north-easterly direction.  No wall was built along about three hundred yards of this part which is absolutely unscalable, but for the rest of the way the walling is continued along the edge of the cliff in a north-east direction for about another three hundred yards.  Here it turns still following the cliff to the south-east for another seven hundred yards, and then gradually rounds to the westward covering four hundred and fifty yards more till it meets the gateway.  But for the break of the inaccessible precipice this outer wall would form a nearly equilateral triangle with the corners rounded off, the side being of some six hundred and fifty yards.  Facing nearly north, about fifty yards from the north-east angle, is a gateway with a couple of curtains in solid masonry.  This entrance is cut in the sides of the cliff about twenty feet below the top which is reached by some dozen steps.  It consisted as usual of a pointed arch, the top fallen in, about ten feet high by five broad.  It leads out to the path down to Girvi, a village in the plains below and it probably formed the communication with Phaltan.  This road winds down the face of the range for some five hundred feet till it hits the shoulder of a spur which it then follows to the base.  The walling on the south side, from the edge of the cliff to some hundred yards east of the southern gate, is not more than a couple of feet in thickness and consists of all-fitting stones unmortared.  The rest is massive and well mortared and still fairly preserved.  The average height is from seven to ten feet.  In the south-east angle is a rude temple of Bhairavnath and a few houses with the remains of Man y more.  On the right side of the southern gate is a well preserved stone pond about thirty yards square with steps leading down to it.  Next to and on the north of Bhairavnath's temple is another pond.  The way up to the fort proper or upper and lower citadels is from the north side.  The path up the hill side, which is steep but with grass and soil left in Man y places, is almost destroyed.  About 150 feet up is the outer citadel built on a sort of shoulder of the hill and facing almost due west.  It contains two massive bastions of excellent masonry looking north-west and south-west so that guns planted on them could comMan d respectively the north and south gateways.  This citadel was connected with the main wall by a cross wall running across the whole breadth of the fort from east to west.  Its entrance lies close below that to the upper citadel.  A masonry curtain projects so as to hide the arch itself, which is not more than seven feet high by three broad, and has to be entered from due east.  On the south side the walls are carried right up to the scarp of the upper citadel and are some ten feet high, so that to take the lower citadel in rear or flank must have been difficult.  The upper citadel is above a vertical scarp some thirty feet high.  The entrance to it lies some thirty feet above that to the lower citadel, and is cut in the rock about eight feet wide.  There is a gateway of a pointed arch with the top fallen in and twenty odd steps leading up to it and ten more cut out of the rock, and winding up past the inside curtain on to the top.  The walls of this upper citadel are still in tolerable preservation.  They were originally about ten feet high and built of fair masonry.  There is a large turret on the south-west corner, evidently meant to comMan d the southern gate.  About ten yards to the east of this turret is a new looking building which was the headquarters or sadar.  Immediately east of this and below it is a great pit about thirty feet square and equally deep roughly cut in the rock and said by the people to be a dungeon.  Next to it on the south is a small pond evenly cut and lined with mortar used for storing water.  There are some remains of sepoys' houses, and, near the turret, a small stone wheel said to belong to a gun.  The outer walls east of the gates have bastions at every turn of the cliffs, and the masonry here is particularly strong and well preserved.  It would appear that attacks were dreaded chiefly from the plain below.  The assailants could either come up the spur towards the north entrance or they might attempt the spurs on the other side of the eastern ravine and attack the southern gateway.  Hence apparently the reason for strengthening the walls of the enceinte on this side.  After passing the southern gateway the assailants would be commanded Maan, Maharashtra from the lower citadel.  They Would then be encountered by the cross wall.  If that obstacle was overcome the besieged would run round the east side and into the two citadels.  The appearance from the fort of the plain in the north is most formidable.  The Panvan plateau completely commands Maan, Maharashtra and almost overhangs it.  The fort is believed to have been built by Shivaji to resist the Moghals whose attacks he must have dreaded from the plain below.  The Karkhanis or Superintendent of the fort was a Prabhu.  The fort garrison consisted of 200 Ramoshis, Mahars, and other hereditary Gadkaris besides sepoys.  It was surrendered in 1818 to Vitthal Pant Phadnis of the Raja of Satara left in charge of the town.  He detached 200 men to take possession, being part of a force then raised to protect the town from the enterprizes of Bajirav's garrisons then in the neighbourhood.

The castle was commissioned either by William the Conqueror or by Robert Fitzhamon, and formed the heart of the medieval town of Cardiff and the Marcher Lord territory of Glamorgan.  In the 12th century the castle began to be rebuilt in stone, probably by Robert of Gloucester, with a shell keep and substantial defensive walls being erected.  Further work was conducted by Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester, in the second half of the 13th century.  Cardiff Castle was repeatedly involved in the conflicts between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh, being attacked several times in the 12th century, and stormed in 1404 during the revolt of Owain Glynd\u0175r."

        "description": "Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation model (PCBH) is a psychological approach to population-based clinical health care that is simultaneously co-located, collaborative, and integrated within the primary care clinic.  The goal of PCBH is to improve and promote overall health within the general population.  This approach is important because approximately half of all patients in primary care present with psychiatric comorbidities, and 60% of psychiatric illness is treated in primary care.  Primary Care practice has traditionally adopted a generalist approach whereby physicians are trained in the medical model and solutions to problems typically involve medications, procedures, and advice.  Appointment times are short, with the goal of seeing a large number of patients in a day.  Many patients present with mental health care needs whose symptomology may overlap with medical disorders and which may exacerbate, complicate, or masquerade as physical symptoms.  In addition, many medical problems present with associated psychological sequelae (e.g. stress, emotional reactions, dysfunctional lifestyle behaviors), that are amenable to change, through behavioral intervention, that can improve outcomes for these health problems.  Over 50% of medical visits to primary care clinics today are related to chronic medical conditions (e.g. chronic pain, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, obesity).  As we learn more and more about the contributing factors to the development and maintenance of these medical problems, there is growing evidence that the PCBH model affords us the opportunity for early identification and behavioral/medical intervention that can prevent some acute problems from becoming chronic health care problems.  Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) work side-by-side with all members of the clinical care team (including primary care providers (PCPs) and nursing staff) to enhance preventive and clinical care for mental health problems that have traditionally been treated solely by physicians.  The role of the BHC is to facilitate systemic change within primary care that facilitates a multidisciplinary approach both from a treatment and reimbursement standpoint.  BHCs typically collaborate with physicians to develop treatment plans, monitor patient progress, and flexibly provide care to meet patients\u2019 changing needs In this review the terms Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation and Behavioral Health Consultation will be used interchangeably."

Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years.  In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area.  Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America.  Prior to being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being focused in North America.  Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control."

The company became closely associated with the Edinburgh Festival after its first appearance there in 1967.  Separating from the Arts Theatre in 1969, the company, renamed The Prospect Theatre Company, survived without a permanent base for the next eight years under the direction of Toby Robertson, mounting productions in which Derek Jacobi and Dorothy Tutin made significant appearances.  Eventually the company found a new home at London's Old Vic in 1977: two years later it became the Old Vic Theatre Company.  Though noted for its exemplary ensemble playing, the company lost its Arts Council of Great Britain funding in 1980 after Timothy West's first season as Robertson's successor, leading to Prospect's demise."

With today\u2019s landfills, there are very constructed contaminate structures.  These systems are designed to help keep solid waste from becoming too uncontained and uncontrolled from the environment and the impact it could have on the health of humans.  The purpose of having a liner system within a landfill is mainly to isolate everything within the landfill from the environment and protect it from contaminating the contents of the soil and especially the water within the ground.  These liners are engineered to create a physical barrier between the garbage within the landfill, the ground, and the environment, in order to separate the liquid contaminate (leachate) so that it can go to a treatment facility.  There are different types of these landfill sites for the different types of solid wastes which society creates and leaves behind.  There are certain levels of harmfulness in which the different types of trash have; therefore, there are different types of liner systems which are required for these different types of disposal sites.  The first type is single liner-systems.  These systems usually are put within landfills which mostly hold construction rubble.  These landfills are not meant to hold the disposal of harmful liquid wastes such as paint, tar, or any other type of liquid garbage that can easily seep through a single liner system.  The second type is double-liner systems.  These systems are usually found in municipal solid waste landfills as well all hazardous waste landfills.  The first part is constructed to collect the leachate while the second layer is engineered to be a leak-detection system to ensure that no contaminates leak into the ground and contaminate everything."

It is hard to identify merenhouse based on its time signature and rhythm alone.  Some merenhouse music is in a fast 2/4 beat and has typical merengue style rhythms.  Some also is in a slower 4/4 beat, identifying more with the hip hop style.  Merenhouse can be characterized mostly by the instruments/electronics used and the combination of vocal styles."

She is best remembered for her character role as Susie Baxter, the daughter of Steve and Barbara Baxter and the first cousin of Harold \"Sport\" Baxter on the 1960s sitcom \"Hazel.\"  Benjamin was also well known for her roles in the movies \"Mr. and Mrs. Bo Jo Jones\" and \"The Jordan Chance.\"  Benjamin's career began at the age of eight on \"Hazel\" in 1965.  \"Hazel\" was a sitcom that first aired in 1961 on NBC.  The series centered on the Baxter family.  The family included husband George Baxter, (Don DeFore), his wife Dorothy Baxter, (Whitney Blake) and their only child, son Harold \"Sport\" Baxter, (Bobby Buntrock).  At the end of the 1964-65 television season, NBC canceled the series.  CBS decided to pick it up for a fifth season.  CBS cast Ray Fulmer, Lynn Borden, and Benjamin as George Baxter's brother Steve, his wife Barbara and their daughter Susie.  The premise of the fifth season was that George and Dorothy had to move to the Middle East as part of a job promotion.  So, Hazel and Harold moved in with Steve, Barbara, and Susie.  The series was cancelled by CBS airing its last episode on April 11, 1966.  It was never picked up again.  After Hazel, Benjamin would only get roles in a limited few number of movies and guest starring roles on television.  After Hazel went off the air, Benjamin would have only five roles in movies and television.  Her television credits include three guest starring roles on the television shows \"My Three Sons,\" \"The Rockford Files\" and \"Riptide.\"  Her movie credits include two TV movies; \"Mr. and Mrs. Bo Jo Jones\" (1971), and \"The Jordan Chance\" (1978).  \"Riptide\" was Benjamin's last acting appearance.  She has not acted in anything since."

A boar (adult male) weighs around 350 \u2013 , while a sow (adult female) is about half that size.  Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet.  Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice.  Their scientific name means \"maritime bear\" and derives from this fact.  Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present.

It was named by the Finnish paleontologist Bj\u00f6rn Kurt\u00e9n in 1964 and is interpreted to represent a relatively large subadult individual: the ulna is estimated to have been 48.5 cm long when complete.  For comparison, modern subadult polar bear ulnae are 36 - long."

It revolves around the everyday lives of a group of animals mingling with humans at a caf\u00e9 run by a polar bear.  An anime adaptation by Studio Pierrot aired in Japan between April 2012 and March 2013.  While it never received an official international release (mostly due to its heavy emphasis on Japanese wordplay, which complicates the potential for dubbing into other languages), it is available on the streaming website Crunchyroll as Polar Bear Cafe alongside the television broadcast for global audiences."

He was born in the United States and transferred to Argentina in 1993.  His companion, a female named Pelusa, died of cancer in 2012.  The living conditions of the cage Arturo resided in were controversial, as temperatures reach up to 40\u00b0C in Argentina, and the pool in Arturo's cage was only 20 inches deep.  Animal rights activists had, in response, dubbed Arturo the \"world's saddest animal\" and promoted a petition to have him moved to Assiniboine Park Zoo, a zoo in Winnipeg, Canada.  The petition was created by Laura Morales of Hamilton, Ontario.  It gained considerable attention after the hashtag #Freearturo began trending on Twitter.  Supporters of the petition also noted that a polar bear died in Buenos Aires in December 2012 due to excessive heat, and argued that Arturo exhibited symptoms of depression and other mental health problems."

The two Bagnalls were temporarily taken out of service in the 1920s when they were replaced by a pair of battery locomotives.  These proved unsatisfactory, and \"Polar Bear\" and \"Sea Lion\" were returned to traffic.  The railway was closed for the duration of World War II, and when the line reopened in the late 1940s only \"Polar Bear\" was returned to traffic.  Following the 1962 closure of the GGR, \"Polar Bear\" was sold to the Brockham Museum Trust in 1967.  In 1982 it passed, with the rest of the Brockham collection, to the Amberley Museum Railway, where it was returned to traffic in the early 1980s.  \"Polar Bear\"'s boiler was condemned around 1988, returning to service with a new boiler in 1993.  Its boiler certificate expired at the end of 2010; with a retube and work on the firebox being required before a return to service.  Since being based at Amberley, \"Polar Bear\" has returned to the Groudle Glen on three occasions (1993, 1996 and 2005) to visit."

At around the same time, Fox's commissioned a taxidermist to shoot and stuff a real polar bear, which was put out on display at such public events as football matches and carnivals to advertise the Glacier Mints.  The exhibition was taken all over the country, and eventually incorporated as many as four other stuffed polar bears.  In the 1960s, after the advent of televised advertising and after Rowntrees acquired the company, the exhibition was deemed politically incorrect and was removed from public circulation.

It was released in May 1983 as the second single from Williams' album \"Strong Stuff\".  The song reached number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart.  It was written by Williams, Dean Dillon, Gary Stewart and Tanya Tucker.  The song is notable for its combination of two singers associated with the outlaw movement with a country legend from the honky tonk days and golden age of the Grand Ole Opry.  Outlaw singers like Williams and Jennings saw themselves as taking country music back to its raw, honky tonk roots, and recording an up tempo song with Tubb (who would never have received radio airplay in the late 1970s and early 80's) and reaching #6 was a slap in the face to the proponents of the country pop sound.  The lyrics of the song, much like Williams' \"Family Tradition\" echo the sentiment that the outlaw singers and their current escapades were predated by the hard living honky tonkers of the 1950s such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Ernest Tubb, prior to the music being fairly taken over by the Nashville Sound in the 1960s."

In her half-century of artistic works, she garnered over seventeen awards of national and international recognition.  Beginning her career in a Pop Art style which moved towards abstract, her trajectory moved toward cubism and realism as she explored light, color, sensuality and the bounty of her surroundings.  Her reinterpretations of master painters led her to an exploration of Colombian multiculturalism, and her later works focused on Afro-Colombian and mestizo heritage within the Colombian landscape.  Her works can be found in the permanent collections of the Fuji Art Museum in Tokyo; the in Zaragoza, Spain; the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City; the Nassau County Museum of Art of Roslyn Harbor, New York, as well as the Bogot\u00e1 Museum of Modern Art and museums in other Latin American cities.

Fairly serious in content with a focus on radical organizing issues, it was loosely aligned with the SDS movement.  The first issue was dated March, 1969, with two editorial offices in New York, where Carol Brightman, Beverly Leman, and Kathy McAfee were listed on the first masthead, later to be joined by a number of others including Marge Piercy and Sol Yurick; and San Francisco, where the collective included Peter Booth Wiley, Carole Deutch, Danny Beagle, Bob Gavriner, Al Haber, Bruce Nelson, and David Wellman.  Part of the inspiration for the paper was a desire to fill the gap created by the demise of the influential New Left organ \"Studies on the Left\", and the core group included people from the antiwar newsletter \"Viet Report\"."

It is often noted for its message of how a patriarchal society puts expectations and pressures on women, partly through gender role stereotyping.  It tells a story about a girl who dies trying to meet the unrealistic expectations that society holds for her.  It starts off talking about a little girl, and then continues chronologically through the girl\u2019s life.  Using strong diction, purposeful syntax, and various rhetorical devices, the poem hits on prominent feminist issues such as gender stereotypes, sexism, and the effect of a patriarchal society."

Despite the acclaimed success of 1997's Moenia and 1998's remix album, in itself a risky and previously-unheard of novelty in the Mexican music industry, and due to disagreements between Lozano, Jorge Soto and Alejandro 'Midi' Ortega as to the creative route Moenia should take, Lozano decided to leave Moenia as vocalist with original founding member Alfonso Pichardo returning as lead singer.  Lozano then formed the perhaps less commercial, still synth-oriented, but more guitar-centered Morbo, whose musical vision first came to fruition in 2001's eponymous \"Morbo\"."

The river begins its course at the confluence of the rivers Mbirurume and Mwogo in the South West of the country.  These two rivers themselves begin in Nyungwe Forest, and are considered by some to be the most distant source of the Nile.  From its start, Nyabarongo flows northward for 85\u00a0km (53 miles), and forms the border between the Western and Southern Provinces.  At the confluence with the river Mukungwa, the river changes course and flows eastward for 12\u00a0km (7.5 miles), then to a more South Eastern course for the last 200\u00a0km (124 miles).  For the longest stretch of this course, the river serves as the boundary between the Northern and Southern Provinces, then between the City of Kigali and the Southern Province, and lastly between the City of Kigali and the Eastern Province.  The river then before enters the Eastern Province and ends its course close to the border with Burundi.  The Nyabarongo River empties both in Lake Rweru and Akagera river in a small but complicated Delta.  The Akagera river outflows from Lake Rweru, a mere 1\u00a0km from the Nyabarongo delta.  Almost all the branches of the Nyabarongo delta empty in the lake, however, one branch of the delta empties directly in the just formed Akagera river.  The Akagera River eventually flows into Lake Victoria and forms the Nile."

It was also shown on Animax, who have broadcast the series across its respective networks worldwide, including Japan, Southeast Asia, South Asia, East Asia, and other regions.  It was created to celebrate the birth date of Atom/Astro Boy (as well as the 40th anniversary of the original TV series).  Under the original English name (instead of \"Mighty Atom\"), it kept the same classic art style as the original manga and anime, but was revisioned and modernized with more lush, high-quality, near-theatrical animation and visuals.  It combined the playfulness of the early anime with the darker, more serious and dramatic Science fiction themes of the manga and the 1980 series.  The anime broadcast in Japan on the same date as Atom's/Astro's birth in the manga (April 6, 2003) across Animax and Fuji Television.  It was directed by Kazuya Konaka and written by Chiaki J.

The game's presentation and battle system is broadly similar to that of the main series, but it differed in its inclusion of action-adventure game elements.  \"Final Fantasy Mystic Quest\" was the first \"Final Fantasy\" game to be released in Europe."

It was released on 12 September 1975 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and a day later by Columbia Records in the United States.  Inspired by material the group composed while performing around Europe, \"Wish You Were Here\" was recorded during numerous recording sessions at Abbey Road Studios in London, England.  Two of the album's four songs criticise the music business, another expresses alienation and the multi-part track \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" is a tribute to Syd Barrett.  Barrett's mental breakdown had forced him to leave the group seven years earlier, prior to the release of the group's second studio album \"A Saucerful of Secrets\" (on which he only appeared on three tracks).  It was lead writer Roger Waters' idea to split \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" into two parts that would bookend the album around three new compositions and to introduce a concept linking them all.  The band had used a linking concept for their previous album, \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", to great success.  As with \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", the band used studio effects and synthesizers and brought in guest singers to supply vocals on some tracks of the album.  These singers were Roy Harper, who provided the lead vocals on \"Have a Cigar\", and the Blackberries, who added backing vocals to \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\"."

        "description": "\u00c6lfwine Haroldsson or \u00c6lfwine was most probably an illegitimate son of King Harold Harefoot of England.  He was probably born during the early 1030s, either in Scandinavia or after 1035 in England.  He appears in an early twelfth-century cartulary from the monastery of Sainte Foi at Conques in Aquitaine as \"Alboynus\" (a cognate of \u00c6lfwine), alongside the records that he was born in London and was the son of a King \"Heroldus\" (a Latinised version of Harold) and one \"Alveva\" (\"\u00c6lfgifu\" Latinised).  It is also noted that he arrived in Conques in 1060 on pilgrimage and persuaded the local authorities to rebuild the church and make him prior.  W. H. Stevenson showed the only chronologically plausible candidate for his father is King Harold Harefoot.  With Harold Harefoot's sudden death on 17 March 1040 \u00c6lfwine was most likely left in his otherwise unknown mother's care, or even that of his powerful and influential grandmother \u00c6lfgifu of Northampton, who may be the \u00c6lfgifu of the record mistakenly named as his mother, rather than grandmother.  He did not lay any claim to the throne of England.  Little is known about him, but he is thought to have died in the 1070s or 1080s.  He was a grandson of Cnut the Great."

It was first used as a port in prehistoric times when a sandstone ledge was used to unload the ships of overseas traders.  However, by 1381 the Countess Weir had blocked the river to shipping.  A canal was completed in 1566 to provide access for ships.  Over time the number of ships using the quayside increased and so the quay was expanded in the late 17th century.  Further expansion occurred in 1830 when a new canal basin was dug.  However, in 1840 the railways reached Exeter and the shipping began to decline.  The quayside no longer has any shipping but is now mostly used for leisure."

The highest tides of the year may be known as the king tide, with the month varying by location.  In Florida, controversy was created when state-level government mandated that the term \"nuisance flooding\" and other terms be used in place of terms such as sea level rise, climate change and global warming, prompting allegations of climate change denial, specifically against Governor Rick Scott.  This amid Florida, specifically South Florida and the Miami metropolitan area being one of the most at risk areas in the world for the potential effects of sea level rise, and where the frequency and severity of tidal flooding events increased in the 21st century.  The issue is more bipartisan in South Florida, particularly in places like Miami Beach, where a several hundred million dollar project is underway to install more than 50 pumps and physically raise roads to combat the flooding, mainly along the west side of South Beach, formerly a mangrove wetland where the average elevation is less than one meter (3.3 feet).  In the Miami area, where the vast majority of the land is below 10 ft , even a one-foot increase over the average high tide can cause widespread flooding.  The 2015 and 2016 king tide event levels reached about 4 ft MLLW, 3 ft above mean sea level, or about 2 ft NAVD88, and nearly the same above MHHW.  While the tide range is very small in Miami, averaging about 2 ft , with the greatest range being less than 2 m , the area is very acute to minute differences down to single inches due to the vast area at low elevation.  NOAA tide gauge data for most stations shows current water level graphs relative to a fixed datum, as well as mean sea level trends for some stations.  During the king tides, the local Miami area tide gauge at Virginia Key shows levels running at times 1 ft or more over datum."

        "description": "North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is a deep water mass formed in the North Atlantic Ocean.  Thermohaline circulation of the world's oceans involves the flow of warm surface waters from the southern hemisphere into the North Atlantic.  Water flowing northward becomes modified through evaporation and mixing with other water masses, leading to increased salinity.  When this water reaches the North Atlantic it cools and sinks through convection, due to its decreased temperature and increased salinity resulting in increased density.  NADW is the outflow of this thick deep layer, which can be detected by its high salinity, high oxygen content, nutrient minima, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  CFCs are anthropogenic substances that enter the surface of the ocean from gas exchange with the atmosphere.  This distinct composition allows its path to be traced as it mixes with Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), which in turn fills the deep Indian Ocean and part of the South Pacific.  NADW and its formation is essential to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which is responsible for transporting large amounts of water, heat, salt, carbon, nutrients and other substances from the Tropical Atlantic to the Mid and High Latitude Atlantic.  In the conveyor belt model of thermohaline circulation of the world's oceans, the sinking of NADW pulls the waters of the North Atlantic drift northward; however, this is almost certainly an oversimplification of the actual relationship between NADW formation and the strength of the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic drift."

The Greenland Sea is often defined as part of the Arctic Ocean, sometimes as part of the Atlantic Ocean.  However, definitions of the Arctic Ocean and its seas tend to be imprecise or arbitrary.  In general usage the term \"Arctic Ocean\" would exclude the Greenland Sea.  In oceanographic studies the Greenland Sea is considered part of the Nordic Seas, along with the Norwegian Sea.  The Nordic Seas are the main connection between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and, as such, could be of great significance in a possible shutdown of thermohaline circulation.  In oceanography the Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas are often referred to collectively as the \"Arctic Mediterranean Sea\", a marginal sea of the Atlantic."

It follows the story of a man who settles and lives in rural Norway.  First published in 1917, it has since been translated from Norwegian into languages such as English.  The novel was written in the popular style of Norwegian new realism, a movement dominating the early 20th century.  The novel exemplified Hamsun's aversion to modernity and inclination towards primitivism and the agrarian lifestyle.  The novel employed literary techniques new to the time such as stream of consciousness.  Hamsun tended to stress the relationship between his characters and the natural environment.  Growth of the Soil portrays the protagonist (Isak) and his family as awed by modernity, yet at times, they come into conflict with it.  The novel contains two sections entitled \"Book One\" and \"Book Two\".  The first book focuses almost solely on the story of Isak and his family and the second book starts off by following the plight of Axel and ends mainly focusing on Isak's family."

The law was discovered and published by the English physicist Henry Moseley in 1913.  It is historically important in quantitatively justifying the conception of the nuclear model of the atom, with all, or nearly all, positive charges of the atom located in the nucleus, and associated on an integer basis with atomic number.  Until Moseley's work, \"atomic number\" was merely an element's place in the periodic table, and was not known to be associated with any measureable physical quantity.  Moseley was able to show that the frequencies of certain characteristic X-rays emitted from chemical elements are proportional to the square of a number which was close to the element's atomic number; a finding which supported Van den Broek and Bohr's model of the atom in which the atomic number is the same as the number of positive charges in the nucleus of the atom.  In brief, the law states that the square root of the frequency of the emitted x-ray is proportional to the atomic number."

He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide.  Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey.  Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\".  He released his debut album, \"The Voice of Frank Sinatra\", in 1946.  Sinatra's professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known performers as part of the Rat Pack.  His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of \"From Here to Eternity\", with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including \"In the Wee Small Hours\" (1955), \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers! \" (1956), \"Come Fly with Me\" (1958), \"Only the Lonely\" (1958) and \"Nice 'n' Easy\" (1960)."

Ruhtenberg was involved in the Bauhaus movement in Germany, studying under Mies van der Rohe and worked with Philip Johnson.  In \"The International Style: Architecture Since 1922\" Johnson acknowledges Ruhtenberg as one of two \u201ckind friends\u201d who have read and criticized draft texts.  Johnson and fellow author Henry-Russell Hitchcock included Ruhtenberg\u2019s 1930 Berlin apartment house interior among their illustrations of modern design.  In his biography of Philip Johnson, architectural historian Franz Schulze refers to Ruhtenberg as Johnson's new friend during the latter's travels in Germany in 1929.  The two visited the Bauhaus in Dessau together.  At the time Ruhtenberg was a public relations aide to designer Bruno Paul.  Johnson, working with Henry-Russell Hitchcock, was gathering material for \"The International Style: Architecture Since 1922.\"  Ruhtenberg was traveling with them.  Schulze cites Johnson's letter of 17 September 1930 to J. J. P. Oud, a Dutch modernist architect, in which Johnson called Ruhtenberg his best friend, describing him as a beginning architecture student.  Three years later in another letter to Oud, Johnson tells him that he is building a house in Manhattan with his friend Jan Ruhtenberg.  He was active in many areas of country such as New York City with both his architectural skills (the renovation of 57 East 93rd Street that was reviewed by \"Architectural Forum\" in 1937); He is \"credited\" with the interior design of Nelson Rockefeller's Penthouse at 810 Fifth Avenue (62nd Street) by the New York Times;  and his opinions on the progressive housing movement which were recorded for the Library of Congress."

However, if a Deputy Prime Minister has not been appointed, the Minister in the cabinet who has served the longest time (and if there are several with equal experience the one who is oldest) takes over as head of government.  Note that the person acting as Prime Minister does not do so on a permanent basis: if a Prime Minister dies, resigns or loses a vote of confidence in the Riksdag, the Speaker of the Riksdag will then confer with the parties of the Riksdag and propose a new Prime Minister, who must be tolerated by a majority of the Riksdag.  If the Prime Minister has resigned or lost a vote of confidence, he or she will remain the head of a government \"ad interim\" until the new Prime Minister assumes his or her office.  The only case where the governmental line of succession becomes relevant is when the Prime Minister dies (upon which the person next in the line of succession serves as the head of a government \"ad interim\") or when the Prime Minister is on leave or for any other reason incapable of serving, but still remains in office.  This might be compared to the Presidential line of succession in the United States, where the person next in line assumes the Presidency throughout the remainder of the term if the President dies, resigns or is impeached."

        "description": "An intermediate cartridge is a rifle/carbine cartridge that is less powerful than typical full-power battle rifle cartridges, such as the .303 British, 7.62\u00d754mmR, 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser, .30-06 Springfield or 7.62\u00d751mm NATO, but still has significantly longer effective range than pistol cartridges.  As their recoil is significantly reduced compared to high power rifle cartridges, fully automatic rifles firing intermediate cartridges are relatively easy to control.  However, even though less powerful than a traditional full-power rifle cartridge, the ballistics are still sufficient for an effective range of 250 \u2013 , which are the maximum typical engagement ranges in modern combat.  This allowed for the development of the assault rifle, a selective fire weapon that is more compact and lighter than rifles that fire full power cartridges.  The first intermediate cartridge to see widespread service was the German 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz used in the StG 44.  Other notable examples include the Soviet 7.62\u00d739mm used in the AK-47 and AKM series, 5.45x39mm first used in the AK-74, and the American 5.56\u00d745mm NATO cartridge first used in the M16."

This device was designed by Theodore Berger, a Biomedical Engineer and Neurologist at University of Southern California.  Berger started to work on this chip in the early 1990s.  He and his colleagues have been able to implant electrodes into rats and monkeys that restore their memories after previously being impaired.  While researchers are well into developing an actual memory prosthesis in animals, they still need to show that their chips can form long-term memories in many different behavioral situations.  Berger hopes to eventually use these chips as electronic implants for humans whose brains that suffer from diseases such as Alzheimer's that disrupt neuronal networks."

Ticks also transmit numerous kinds of viruses, bacteria, and protozoa between domestic animals.  These microbes cause diseases which can be severely debilitating or fatal to domestic animals, and may also affect humans.  Ticks are especially important to domestic animals in tropical and subtropical countries, where the warm climate enables many species of ticks to flourish.  Also, the large populations of wild animals in warm countries provide a reservoir of ticks and infective microbes that spread to domestic animals.  Farmers of livestock animals use many methods to control ticks, and related treatments are used to reduce infestation of companion animals.  Veterinarians and animal health agencies work at private, national, and international scales to reduce the harm caused by ticks and their associated diseases."

Gauss at G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, during which time he published approximately 20 papers on the observation and motion of comets and asteroids. Following completion of his Ph.D. (he was the first American to receive this degree in astronomy) he toured European observatories asking for advice on what could be done to further astronomy as a professional science in the U.S.A.  The main advice he received was to start a professional journal modeled after what was then the world's leading astronomical publication, the Astronomische Nachrichten."

This was the at Old Trafford which England lost by 3 runs, and with it the series.  Tate had the misfortune to drop a crucial swerving lofted pull off the left-handed Australian captain, Joe Darling, the bowler being the leg-spinner Len Braund from the now Brian Statham End: just forward of square leg, in front of the refreshment stall (the bowler's testimony, and photos locate the structure), slightly in from the boundary, rail/tram-line side of the ground.  England lost their ninth wicket in their second innings with eight wanted for victory.  Tate joined Wilfred Rhodes and edged his first ball for four, but the fourth ball he received from Saunders bowled him.  The patch of turf on which Tate dropped the catch is now in the pavilion lawn at Whalley Range Cricket Club, after Old Trafford lifted its playing area in August 2008, as is that where Clem Hill took his famous running catch in front of the pavilion in the same game.

It is a High Victorian Gothic influenced brick structure with Romanesque Revival overtones built 1865-67.  It has a tall central tower and featured an ornate interior with marble sculpture and murals.  The church is 184 feet long, 65 feet wide, and the ceiling is 51 feet from the floor.  The steeple, at 256 feet, is the second tallest church tower in the city (next to First and Franklin Street Presbyterian Church at West Madison Street and Park Avenue, in Mount Vernon-Belveere neighborhood, constructed 1875), which dominates Old East Baltimore.  The cross surmounting the spire, is 10 feet tall.  There is a peal of four bells in the tower, the largest weighing 5000 pounds, cast by McShane of Baltimore, in 1885.  The tower clock was installed during the same year.  The magnificent and priceless 25 foot-high Mayer windows were installed in 1891.  The church is an early work of George A. Frederick (1842-1924), a prolific and prominent architect in Baltimore who designed various buildings in the city including the Baltimore City Hall in 1875.  The interior features three large interior murals painted about 1886 by the German-born artist William Lamprecht and marble sculpture work by the Baltimore sculptor Joseph Martin Sudsburg.  In 1966, the neighbouring parish of St. John the Evangelist was closed, and the new parish of St. James and St. John, was formed, the congregation worshipping at St. James.  The parish was dissolved around 1986, and the former St. James Church was sold to an evangelical church.  Most regrettably, the church has been stripped of its windows, altars, marble communion rail, pipe organ, and other artifacts, and the church has been whitewashed, destroying its beautiful and historic murals."

Born to an ecclesiastical family, he became a monk at Cluny Abbey in France at about the age of twenty.  After holding two posts as prior in the Cluniac order he was appointed Abbot of Gloucester Abbey in 1139, a promotion influenced by his kinsman Miles of Gloucester.  During his tenure as abbot he acquired additional land for the abbey, and may have helped to fabricate some charters\u2014legal deeds attesting property ownership\u2014to gain advantage in a dispute with the Archbishops of York.  Although Foliot recognised Stephen as the King of England, he may have also sympathised with the Empress Matilda's claim to the throne.  He joined Matilda's supporters after her forces captured Stephen, and continued to write letters in support of Matilda even after Stephen's release."

Initially the battle raged throughout most of Warsaw, but after a short time it became confined to districts in the West of the town.  The key factor in the battle was the massive imbalance of weapons between the two sides.  The German side was extremely well equipped whilst the Polish side had, initially, barely enough ammunition for a few days.  The policy of \"one bullet, one German\" allowed the Polish fighters to sustain the uprising for many weeks at the cost of their own lives.  Some areas fought for a full 63 days before an agreed capitulation took place.  The losses on the Polish side amounted to 18,000 soldiers killed, 25,000 wounded and over 250,000 civilians killed; those on the German side amounted to over 17,000 soldiers killed and 9,000 wounded."

It was formed in 1881 under the Childers Reforms by the amalgamation of the 26th Cameronian Regiment and the 90th Perthshire Light Infantry.  In 1968, when reductions were required, the regiment chose to be disbanded rather than amalgamated with another regiment, one of only two infantry regiments in the British Army to do so, with the other being the York and Lancaster Regiment.  It can trace its roots to that of the Cameronians, later the 26th of Foot, who were raised in 1689.  The 1881 amalgamation coincided with the Cameronian's selection to become the new Scottish Rifles."

After 1947 the regiment was one of only four Gurkha regiments to be transferred to the British Army and this continued up until 1994, when it was amalgamated with other Gurkha regiments to form the Royal Gurkha Rifles.

Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register.  A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type.  The discipline of voice classification developed within European classical music and is not generally applicable to other forms of singing.  Voice classification is often used within opera to associate possible roles with potential voices.  Several different voice classification systems are available to identify voice types, including the German \"Fach\" system and the choral music system among many others; no system is universally applied or accepted."

Argentina's first native born opera composer was Francisco Hargreaves (1849-1900) who composed \"La gatta bianca\" (1875) and \"Los estudiantes de Bologna\" (1897), followed by Zen\u00f3n Rol\u00f3n (1856-1902) who composed several operas as well as operettas and zarzuelas.  The works of many of the composers from this generation were first performed outside Argentina.  Native Argentine opera was to develop much more with the massive European (mainly Italian) immigration in the late 19th century and even more with the opening of the Teatro Col\u00f3n in 1908 where most of the 20th century operas listed here had their world premieres.  Some of the first operas to treat Argentine subjects or national themes were Arturo Berutti's \"Pampa\" (1897) based on the life of Juan Moreira and \"Yupanki\" (1899) based on the life of Inca warrior Manqu Inka Yupanki.  Also notable in this genre were Felipe Boero's \"Tucum\u00e1n\" (1918) set during the Battle of Tucum\u00e1n and \"El matrero\" (1929).  Considered by many to be the quintessential Argentine opera, \"El matrero\" had a libretto based on gaucho folk tradition and incorporated Argentine folk melodies and a traditional gaucho dance.  The Spanish playwright Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca was also the inspiration for several Argentine operas.  His plays, \"La zapatera prodigiosa\" and \"Bodas de sangre\", were the basis of operas by Juan Jos\u00e9 Castro, while Osvaldo Golijov's 2003 opera \"Ainadamar\" is based on events in the playwright's life."

Cobb\" capsized in heavy seas on 1 December 1896 en route from Brunswick, Georgia to New York with a cargo of timber and cross ties.  The cook and a shipmate drowned when they were swept overboard in violent seas.  The crew righted the vessel by removing the three masts and they drifted for four days until they became grounded on a sandbar off Ormond Beach, Florida.  Rescue attempts led to the drowning of volunteer Ferd Waterhouse, whose body was never recovered, but no other crew members were lost.  A plaque commemorates Ferd Waterhouse\u2019s rescue efforts.

In 1937-39, a proposal to build a highway through the route led to a survey exploration, but the route was not completed.  A highway access from other parts of British Columbia to the Peace Country was not made until much later, with the construction of the John Hart Highway through the Pine Pass; the route is now the Monkman Pass Historical Trail, built in 2006-07 and opened in 2008.  The pass is at the head of the Murray River and south of the height of land at the head of the Parsnip River, and was discovered by accident by its namesake, Peace River Country fur trapper Alexander Monkman in 1922 who crossed it by sled and dogs."

Where Max Weber used the model of the bureaucracy to represent the direction of this changing society, Ritzer sees the fast-food restaurant as having become a more representative contemporary paradigm (Ritzer, 2004:553).  The process of McDonaldization can be summarized as the way in which \"the principles of the fast-food restaurant are coming to dominate more and more sectors of American society as well as of the rest of the world.\""

MOM will also contain information which our society is obliged to forward to the future: e.g. description of nuclear waste repositories.  MOM collaborates with the NEA and SKB.  Although the most obvious ambition and often described in the media is the concern about preserving our knowledge, this is not the primary goal of MOM.  Serving as a time capsule MOM is both: in a time frame of millennia it is the story about us, and in a time frame of decades it is a backup.  In times where global warming, nuclear danger and biological warfare threaten the existence of civilization, saving the core knowledge and culture acquired over centuries is a backup measure.  In case of a collapse, the MOM project could help survivors to rebuild civilization.  Linked to this, an another reason is of political order: facing the lack of reactivity of authorities concerning global warming, the MOM project is a reminder of what can happen.  Roman and Greek civilizations whose histories have been reconstructed by the small percentage of texts and artifacts which survived until our days are examples that have inspired the MOM project.  Finally, it's a critic of our digital civilization : according to Kunze, maybe nothing of the 21st century will last in the future, since most of our interactions are now virtual.  The \"accuracy versus bullshit\" is one of the main themes of the MOM project, worried about loss of information, the project can only aim to save a fragment of the information produced until today, but this fragment has to be representative."

This was changed in 1838 when brides were made to be at least 16 years of age and grooms still 18.  Recent additions to the Civil Code have changed the brides' age to 18, along with the grooms' age of 18."

Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times."

By sponsoring cultural activities, education for children, and the establishment of libraries and courses in the Hungarian language, the Society aimed to assimilate Slovaks into the country's Hungarian population while spreading the general use of Hungarian, then the official state language.  It was based in Nyitra, now the city of Nitra in western Slovakia, and was supported by the prominent Hungarian nationalist B\u00e9la Gr\u00fcnwald and the Bishop of Nitra, Imre Bende.  The organisation met some success: between 1900 and 1910, the proportion of self-identified Slovaks in Nyitra County dropped by over 6 percent, thanks in part to its efforts, and by 1910, it was estimated that 21 percent of the Slovak population in the country as a whole had learned Hungarian.  The Society came to operate 227 libraries across Upper Hungary.  Its establishment was followed by the setting up of a similar society in Transylvania.  FEMKE was ultimately dissolved in 1919 after the breakup of the Kingdom of Hungary."

It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens to commemorate employees of the North Eastern Railway (NER) who left to fight in the First World War and were killed while serving.  The NER board voted in early 1920 to allocate \u00a320,000 for a memorial and commissioned Lutyens.  The committee for the York City War Memorial followed suit and also appointed Lutyens, but both schemes became embroiled in controversy.  Concerns were raised from within the community about the effect of the NER memorial on the city walls and its impact on the proposed scheme for the city's war memorial, given that the two memorials were planned to be 100 yd apart and the city's budget was a tenth of the NER's.  The controversy was resolved after Lutyens modified his plans for the NER memorial to move it away from the walls and the city opted for a revised scheme on land just outside the walls; coincidentally the land was owned by the NER, whose board donated it to the city."

Articles in scientific journals are mostly written by active scientists such as students, researchers and professors instead of professional journalists.  There are thousands of scientific journals in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past (see list of scientific journals).  Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as \"Nature\" publish articles and scientific papers across a wide range of scientific fields.  Scientific journals contain articles that have been peer reviewed, in an attempt to ensure that articles meet the journal's standards of quality, and scientific validity.  Although scientific journals are superficially similar to professional magazines, they are actually quite different.  Issues of a scientific journal are rarely read casually, as one would read a magazine.  The publication of the results of research is an essential part of the scientific method.  If they are describing experiments or calculations, they must supply enough details that an independent researcher could repeat the experiment or calculation to verify the results.  Each such journal article becomes part of the permanent scientific record."

Jackie Chan also campaigned with the Hong Kong Red Cross to raise additional relief funds that went to reconstruction of the site.  Officially, the government does not allow villages to be named after individuals, hence the official name not bearing \"Jackie Chan\".  The neighbourhood is built up on a hill, high enough to avoid being inundated by a tsunami, thus being safe from tsunamis.  The village is a green field construction, where only treed hills and farmers' fields once stood.  It is located 25 minutes, some 17\u00a0km, outside of central Banda Aceh.  The village is 1.5\u00a0km inland and elevated 300m.  The village has a clinic and kindergarten and a covered village square for a market.  However the market has not worked out.  There are 606 mostly single family homes in the village.  The village was built by a Chinese contractor.  The quality of the build is reasonable, unlike some other similar reconstruction efforts in Aceh.  There is no local high school, and the public transport system is insufficient to needs, as most jobs are located far from the village.  The village opened in 2007 with 2400 residents from a variety of villages and a variety of ethnic groups.  They have lived harmoniously and built a community together.  As of 2014, the community's kindergarten is currently unused.  Some 1200 people remain, others having moved away to be closer to work or services.

One of Moody's chief goals was the creation of a wholly separate women's college at Middlebury, as opposed to the semi-integrated system that had prevailed since women were first accepted in 1883.

After the initial stages, Philip II deployed his armies and regained control over most of the rebelling provinces.  Under the leadership of the exiled William the Silent, the northern provinces continued their resistance.  They eventually were able to oust the Habsburg armies, and in 1581 they established the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands.  The war continued in other areas, although the heartland of the republic was no longer threatened; this included the beginnings of the Dutch Colonial Empire, which at the time were conceived as carrying overseas the war with Spain.  After a 12-year truce, hostilities broke out again around 1619, which can be said to coincide with the Thirty Years' War.  An end was reached in 1648 with the Peace of M\u00fcnster (a treaty part of the Peace of Westphalia), when the Dutch Republic was recognised as an independent country (though the fact of its being such was evident long before)."

The power canal was a major factor in the Industrial revolution in New England in the 19th century.  Most early power canals were mill races used mechanically to transfer power directly from falling water to machinery in mill buildings.  Later, the hydraulic power generated electricity locally for the same mill factories.  These power canals were often filled in as electricity (transported by power lines) replaced the need for local water power, and road transport needs or city expansion needs reclaimed the land.  Some hydraulic power canals were transformed into local electric generators, but most were closed.  Remains of power canals can be seen in old mill towns and are often protected as historical structures today."

Big Daddies are heavily spliced (genetically mutated and altered with ADAM) human beings who have had their bodies directly grafted into heavily armored, steampunk-inspired atmospheric diving suits.  They are armed with a rivet gun, heavy drill, rocket launcher, or ion laser.  Alpha series Big Daddies are equipped with any of several other weapons as well.  Though they make low-pitched groaning noises similar to whales, Big Daddies have no voice actor attributed to them.  Designed by Irrational Games (then under the supervision of 2K Boston/2K Australia), they first appeared in \"BioShock\" and were promoted heavily.  A six-inch Big Daddy action figure was included in the limited edition version of the title.  In its sequel, \"BioShock 2\", the player controls a prototype Big Daddy."
