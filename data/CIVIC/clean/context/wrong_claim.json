All cases were confirmed by molecular testing to harbor YAP1::TFE3 gene fusions, 88% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 4 and 12% with YAP1 exon 1 fused to TFE3 exon 6. The predicted fusion protein contains the TEAD binding site of YAP1 (located in exon 1), which is essential for tethering the protein to genes to activate transcription, and swaps the YAP1 transactivating domain for the basic helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains of TFE3. Thus the fusion protein acts as a transcription factor that utilizes the transactivating domains and nuclear localization sequences of TFE3 and binds DNA through the TEAD binding site on YAP1, resulting in a constitutively active chimeric transcription factor. YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) are highly homologous transcriptional co-regulators that are downstream nuclear effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway. In EHE with WWTR1::CAMTA1 gene fusion, WWTR1::CAMTA1 acts as a constitutively active form of TAZ. Thus the a YAP-like transcriptional program in YAP1::TFE3 fused EHE, is considered analogous to WWTR1::CAMTA1 EHE (PMID: 33913810)."

IDH1/2-wildtype status was verified by Sanger sequencing of 24 cases with sufficient DNA. Integrating copy number and RNA sequencing demonstrated MYBL1 (n=14) or MYB (n=6) alterations in 77% (20/26) of these tumors. Nine tumors had MYBL1 rearrangements (including one involving 5\u2019 of MYBL1) with various gene partners, including MMP16 (n=3), RAD51B (n=1), MAML2 (n=1), ZFHX4 (n=1), TOX (n=1), RP11-586K2.1 (intergenic region) (n=1), and RP11492M23.2 (intergenic region) (n=1).

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).",

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.",

The study utilized SNP arrays and FISH to detect MYB rearrangements and quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IMHC) to analyze MYB expression levels. Gains involving MYB and MYB amplifications that upregulate MYB RNA and protein expression were demonstrated in 2/14 diffuse astrocytomas (DAs). No MYB fusions were detected in the two DAs, but the sequence from one DA was found to terminate within MYB exon 9. In addition, the study revealed increased MYB expression in both AGs, with one AG showing a focal deletion in the 3' terminal region of MYB. Overall, increased MYB expression by RT-PCR was seen in 8 LGGs, including 5 DAs, 2 AGs, and 1 oligodendroglioma, and in all three cases with MYB copy number aberrations. IMHC revealed an increase in MYB expression at the protein level in 60% of LGGs including 41% of PAs, and 19% of HGGs. Notably, genomic abnormalities were exclusively observed in diffuse gliomas. The findings suggest that MYB dysregulation may contribute to pediatric gliomas, particularly in diffuse gliomas, through various mechanisms beyond amplification and deletion."

Mutations in the VHL gene were detected by SSCP and DNA sequencing. Haplotypes were determined with four microsatellite polymorphic probes. The missense mutation L184P (c.551T>C) (In the paper noted as nucleotide position 764 and codon position 255 due to old reference transcript), was found in 2 individuals in family 3708. Both individuals were identified with renal cell carcinoma and one also presented with a CNS hemangioblastoma. Additional information regarding the family information, including a pedigree, were not provided. ACMG evidence codes: 'flag for PP4' since the patients phenotype and family history is consistent with VHL, 'flag for PP1' because there is co-segregation of variant with the phenotype in two members of the family."

The patients' ages ranged from 9 to 85 years. For the 35 samples they were able to test successfully, 33 were positive for WWTR1::CAMTA1 (94%) and 2 were positive for YAP1::TFE3 (6%). There were 8 cases with a detected fusion gene via RT-PCR that were negative with FISH testing, and 3 cases negative with RT-PCR that had a positive FISH result. Exon 4 of WWTR1 was fused to CAMTA1 exon 8 in 13 cases and exon 9 in 7 cases, and exon 3 of WWTR1 was fused to CAMTA1 exon 9 in 3 cases. The authors conclude that identification of the fusion in EHEs can provide important diagnostic information, especially in cases with aberrant morphology or limited biopsy material."

The biopsy material was analyzed with a DNA based genotyping panel and RNA-based NGS assay. The latter detected a KANK1::NTRK2 e4::e16 fusion that was confirmed by FISH. Following the partial resection of the tumor and six weeks of concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy, an MRI revealed enhancement of the remaining tumor with no significant disease progression. Larotrectinib (100mg) was administered and after 49 days an MRI displayed significant treatment response as the lesion shrunk (25mm to <10mm) and the patient demonstrated slight motor improvements. By day 106 of Larotrectinib treatment, disease progression was evident. However, molecular analysis of a rebiopsy revealed KANK1::NTRK2 was no longer detectable, but a minor subclone at diagnosis with PDGFRA amplification was driving disease progression. Therefore, the authors conclude the KANK1::NTRK2 clones were effectively targeted by Larotrectinib treatment over several months resulting in a robust clinical response."

The NUTM1 rearrangement was consistent with BRD4::NUTM1 in 8/11 cases and 3/11 were found to have a rearrangement of NUTM1 but not BRD4, suggesting the existence of other rearrangements involving NUTM1 which the authors designate NUT-variant carcinomas.

The study utilized SNP arrays and FISH to detect MYB rearrangements and quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IMHC) to analyze MYB expression levels. Gains involving MYB and MYB amplifications that upregulate MYB RNA and protein expression were demonstrated in 2/14 diffuse astrocytomas (DAs). No MYB fusions were detected in the two DAs, but the sequence from one DA was found to terminate within MYB exon 9. In addition, the study revealed increased MYB expression in both AGs, with one AG showing a focal deletion in the 3' terminal region of MYB. Overall, increased MYB expression by RT-PCR was seen in 8 LGGs, including 5 DAs, 2 AGs, and 1 oligodendroglioma, and in all three cases with MYB copy number aberrations. IMHC revealed an increase in MYB expression at the protein level in 60% of LGGs including 41% of PAs, and 19% of HGGs. Notably, genomic abnormalities were exclusively observed in diffuse gliomas. The findings suggest that MYB dysregulation may contribute to pediatric gliomas, particularly in diffuse gliomas, through various mechanisms beyond amplification and deletion."

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.

ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib \u2013 a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.",

In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations. The most sensitive was an AML cell line (M0-91) with an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion."

The authors concluded that all reports of CCSK with a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion have been detected in males older than the typical age (<4 years of age) of presentation for CCSK, and recommend testing for the BCOR::CCNB3 fusion in CCSK patients lacking a BCOR ITD or YWHAE::NUTM2 gene fusion."

        "description": "A research study performed in 2010 involved 57 pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) and a comparison group of 59 pediatric high-grade gliomas (HGGs). Among the LGG group, there were 34 cases of pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) and 23 cases of diffuse gliomas, which included fibrillary astrocytomas (DA, n=14), oligodendroglial tumors (n=7), and angiocentric gliomas (AG, n=2). The study utilized SNP arrays and FISH to detect MYB rearrangements and quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IMHC) to analyze MYB expression levels. Gains involving MYB and MYB amplifications that upregulate MYB RNA and protein expression were demonstrated in 2/14 diffuse astrocytomas (DAs). No MYB fusions were detected in the two DAs, but the sequence from one DA was found to terminate within MYB exon 9. In addition, the study revealed increased MYB expression in both AGs, with one AG showing a focal deletion in the 3' terminal region of MYB. Overall, increased MYB expression by RT-PCR was seen in 8 LGGs, including 5 DAs, 2 AGs, and 1 oligodendroglioma, and in all three cases with MYB copy number aberrations. IMHC revealed an increase in MYB expression at the protein level in 60% of LGGs including 41% of PAs, and 19% of HGGs. Notably, genomic abnormalities were exclusively observed in diffuse gliomas. The findings suggest that MYB dysregulation may contribute to pediatric gliomas, particularly in diffuse gliomas, through various mechanisms beyond amplification and deletion."

Immunohistochemical staining resulted in CD34 positivity in the lesional cells, negative S100-protein in the spindle cells, and positive Pan-Trk staining in the spindled-cells. Transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) revealed the presence of an in-frame LMNA::NTRK1 fusion (exon4::exon10) that includes the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain.

Larotrectinib was resumed with a dosage increase and again achieved sustained undetectable minimal residual disease after 66 days, and displayed molecular remission through 39 days. The authors suggest larotrectinib as a potential effective treatment for B-cell ALL patients harboring ETV6-NTRK3, including those with CNS infiltration."

All patients diagnosed with de novo AML (337 children and 1,460 adults) or secondary AML (22 children and 119 adults) received comparable therapy. The study concluded that patients with different cytogenetic abnormalities can be divided into 3 prognostic subgroups with favorable, intermediate, and adverse outcomes solely based on the results of cytogenetics. AML with t(8;21) [which results in RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion] was grouped together with AML with inv(16) [CBFB::MYH11 fusion] and t(15;17) [PML::RARA fusion] in the favorable group. The 122 patients with AML with t(8;21) had a 98% CR (complete remission) rate and 2% induction deaths. The observed prognostic associations further support that these abnormalities define clinically and biologically distinct AML subtypes."
