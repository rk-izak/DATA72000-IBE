      "Molecular Profile Summary": "Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.",

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib \u2013 a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.",

Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.

In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.

ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib \u2013 a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib.

Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy."

The TRK pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many cancer types, with NTRK fusions being the best characterized. Larotrectinib and entrectinib are NTRK inhibitors that are FDA approved for patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, including tumors with ETV6-NTRK3 fusions, and are reported to have durable NTRK inhibition. Evaluating response of ETV6-NTRK3 fusion in B-ALL cases to larotrectinib is difficult due to the rarity of the fusion in this cancer type. However, in a limited number of clinical cases of ETV6-NTRK3 in B-ALL, patients harboring these fusions have responded to larotrectinib. One patient demonstrated a response to treatment that was lost on discontinuation of therapy but showed durable response achieving remission on restarting laroterctinib [civic:eid8917]. The functional impact of ETV6-NTRK3 has been demonstrated through increased tumorigenic properties in mice, which mimic human B-ALL [civic:eid8931] and enhanced sensitivity to Larotrectinib both in vivo and in vitro [civic:eid6930].

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).",

Thus the fusion protein acts as a transcription factor that utilizes the transactivating domains and nuclear localization sequences of TFE3 and binds DNA through the TEAD binding site on YAP1, resulting in a constitutively active chimeric transcription factor. YAP1 and WWTR1 (TAZ) are highly homologous transcriptional co-regulators that are downstream nuclear effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway. In EHE with WWTR1::CAMTA1 gene fusion, WWTR1::CAMTA1 acts as a constitutively active form of TAZ.

A MYB::QKI fusion characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (13/15; 87%) with the reamining two tumors harborting a MYB::ESR1 fusion (1/15) or QKI rearrangement (1/15). The last case with QKI rearrangement had no apparent involvement of MYB or MYBL1, only showing split signals using FISH break-apart probes across QKI. However, the study did not have sufficient derivatives from this tumor for FFPE RNA-seq, so it was unable to determine whether a cryptic MYB::QKI aberration was present in this case, or whether QKI was fused to another gene partner. Most MYB::QKI fusions (78%) were between MYB exon 15 and QKI exon 5. Fusions were also identified between MYB exon 9 and QKI exon 5. These fusions removed the 3'UTR regulatory site or the entire inhibitory C-terminal domain of MYB, leading to its overexpression. Two tumors with a MYB::QKI fusion also harbored a BRAF p.V600E mutation."

Eleven CCSK cases were included in the study, from pediatric patients aged 2 - 8 years. Using RT-PCR, BCOR exon 15 ITDs were detected in 10/11 cases, with only 1 case, an 8-year-old male, found to be a double negative. The case was identified to have a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion by a NanoString-based sarcoma fusion assay, with exon 15 of BCOR fused to exon 5 of CCNB3, confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. CCNB3 immunoreactivity was identified in the BCOR::CCNB3 case and not in the BCOR ITD CCSK cases tested. The authors conclude this is the first report of a BCOR::CCNB3 fusion detected in a CCSK of a young child, with the same fusion typically seen in primary bone and soft tissue sarcomas of male adolescents, and that other cases of double negative CCSK require characterization."

Later surveillance by MRI detected multiple sites of tumor enhancement. Authors suggest this case is the first case of adult GBM which showed successful but transitory use of entrectinib therapy."
