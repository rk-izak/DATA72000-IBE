RNA isolated from an EHE with the known t(1;3)(p36;q25) translocation underwent whole-transcriptome sequencing and they detected a fusion that contained exon 2 of WWTR1 fused to exon 9 of CAMTA1. Using RT-PCR they confirmed the presence of the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in another 4 cases of t(1;3)(p36;q25) positive EHE. The fusion involved either exon 2 (type 1 fusion transcript) or exon 3 (type 2 fusion transcript) of WWTR1 in-frame to exon 9 of CAMTA1. To determine the incidence of WWTR1::CAMTA1 they performed FISH with break-apart probes that flanked the WWTR1 or CAMTA1 gene regions on 47 EHE samples. The analysis detected CAMTA1 rearrangement in 39 of 45 EHE tumors (87%) and 42 of 47 (89%) harbored a rearrangement of the WWTR1 gene region, while all other vascular tumors were negative. The authors conclude that the gene fusion is exclusively present in almost all EHEs, demonstrating it to be a disease-defining genetic alteration."

The study included 17 EHE patients with a median age of 48 years (range 25\u201368). FISH analysis confirmed the translocation t(1;3)(1p36.23;3q25.1) in all EHE cases, and breakpoints were mapped to within WWTR1 and CAMTA1. Using RT-PCR they confirmed the WWTR1::CAMTA1 fusion in the three tumors that had suitable tissue available. Exon 4 of WWTR1 was found to be fused to either exon 8 or exon 9 of CAMTA1. Of note, this fusion was not found in any other benign or malignant epithelioid vascular tumors examined, including 13 epithelioid hemangiomas, five epithelioid angiosarcomas, and four epithelioid sarcoma-like EHE.

In 3 cases frozen tissue was available for RNA extraction, and RT-PCR detected the MALAT1(Alpha0::TFEB fusion. The potentially wide size range of MALAT1(Alpha)::TFEB fusion transcripts complicates the detection of this fusion by RT-PCR for robust detection in clinical RNA samples. The lack of splice signals in Alpha resulted in DNA PCR products of the same size as the RT-PCR products when the reverse primer binds to TFEB exon 3.

A BCR::NTRK2 fusion (ex1::ex17) was detected by comprehensive targeted tissue genomic profiling by NGS. NTRK2 protein kinase domain was retained (exons 17-21) in this fusion. Patient completed eight weeks of radiation therapy. However, there was evidence of recurrence. Entrectinib, an NTRK/ROS1/ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was initiated. After 33 weeks of therapy MRI showed decreased size of the recurrent lesion, and by the end of 15 months of therapy the patient remained asymptomatic. Later surveillance by MRI detected multiple sites of tumor enhancement. Authors suggest this case is the first case of adult GBM which showed successful but transitory use of entrectinib therapy."

Western blot revealed the ratio of phosphorylated-Akt/total Akt was higher in the 97-7 cells than in the wild-type cells, which was reversed by siRNA knockdown of FGFR3. Inhibition of Akt signaling by treatment with GDC0068 or LY294002 increased the cisplatin sensitivity of 97-7 cells (IC50 4.17ug/ml & 8.91ug/ml respectively)."

The study included 13 tumors classified as pure SEF and six tumors from 4 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The patients' ages ranged from 18 to 74 years. RNA-seq detected the EWSR1::CREB3L1 gene fusion in 8/13 pure SEF cases, with 2/13 positive for EWSR1::CREB3L2, and one each for FUS::CREM, FUS::CREB3L2, and PAX5::CREB3L1, while all hybrid tumors were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. SNP array showed both the pure SEF and hybrid tumors had multiple imbalances and structural rearrangements, and the authors suggest this could account for the poor outcome of SEF patients compared to LGFMS, which were found to be much less complex."

A total of 18 cases included 10 cases of pure SEF and 8 cases of hybrid SEF/LGFMS. The overall mean age at diagnosis was 44 years (range 18\u201378). The pure SEF cases were found to have the well-known EWSR1::CREB3L1 fusion in 6/10 cases, a previously unidentified EWSR1::CREB3L2 fusion in 2/10 cases, a FUS rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10, and  an EWSR1 rearrangement with an unknown partner in 1/10 case.  On the other hand, the hybrid SEF/LGFMS tumors all showed the presence of a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion. The authors conclude identification of different fusions by gene-specific FISH probes can confirm differences underlying the histologically different pure SEF (mostly EWSR1 rearranged) from LGFMS variants (mainly FUS rearranged)."

Patients with SEF ranged from 28 to 91 years of age. Using RT-PCR, they detected in-frame fusions in 3/4 cases with suitable samples, joining either exon 7, 8, or 11 of EWSR1 to exon 6 of CREB3L1. Split signals at EWSR1 and CREB3L1 were detected by FISH in an additional case. All cases of LGFMS and the hybrid case were found to have a FUS::CREB3L2 fusion by RT-PCR. None of the 10 pure SEFs showed evidence of FUS rearrangement. The authors conclude EWSR1 and CREB3L1 rearrangements are predominant over FUS and CREB3L2 rearrangements in pure SEF, and that SEF and LGFMS are different tumor types."

TRCC with a 6p21 translocation are associated with oncogenic activation of TFEB, most frequently driven by fusions with Alpha (MALAT1). Professional guidelines (WHO) list strong nuclear labelling of TFEB or identification of TFEB fusion as essential diagnostic criteria for TFEB-rearranged renal cell carcinoma (6p21 translocation renal cell carcinoma), a subtype of renal cell carcinoma with MiT translocations (WHO classification of tumours series, 5th ed.; vol. 7).",

        "description": "A subset of renal neoplasms of children and young adults contains t(6;11)(p21;q12), fusion of the MALAT1 (Alpha) gene with the transcription factor gene TFEB. Argani, et al. (2005) included 7 renal neoplasms with cytogenetic and/or molecular evidence of the t(6;11)(p21;q12). The patients ranged from 9 to 33 years in age. All of the 7 renal neoplasms demonstrated either moderate or strong nuclear immunoreactivity for TFEB protein, and 1089 other neoplasms were tested but none showed significant labeling for TFEB. In 3 cases frozen tissue was available for RNA extraction, and RT-PCR detected the MALAT1(Alpha0::TFEB fusion. The potentially wide size range of MALAT1(Alpha)::TFEB fusion transcripts complicates the detection of this fusion by RT-PCR for robust detection in clinical RNA samples. The lack of splice signals in Alpha resulted in DNA PCR products of the same size as the RT-PCR products when the reverse primer binds to TFEB exon 3. The authors conclude that immunoreactivity for TFEB protein is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for these renal neoplasms and suggest that long-range DNA PCR may a useful alternative to RT-PCR due to the special molecular features of the Alpha::TFEB gene fusion."

Identification of either overexpression of the TFEB protein or translocation is a useful method for the diagnosis of TFEB RCCs. However, the results of immunostainings can be inconsistent. This 2012 study included 7 genetically confirmed cases of this rare tumor. The patients\u2019 ages ranged from 21 to 37 years.  All of these tumors showed moderate to strong immunoreactivity for TFEB. DNA PCR performed on genomic DNA extracted from FFPE tissue samples of the tumor identified the Alpha::TFEB fusion gene in 2 cases.  The TFEB partner gene MALAT1 (Alpha) is an intronless, untranslated (non-protein coding) gene of unknown function. The Alpha::TFEB fusion genes were not identified in the other 5 cases. Using a FISH split probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs showed a high percentage of cells with separation signals, and using a fusion probe assay all 7 TFEB RCCs demonstrated fusion signals. They concluded that the diagnosis of such tumors should be based not only on morphology itself but also on immunophenotype and molecular genetic findings."

        "description": "Bakouny, et al. (2022) performed a comprehensive study of the molecular and clinical features of translocation renal cell carcinomas (tRCCs), defined as subtype of kidney cancer driven by MiT/TFE gene fusions. Across the combined tRCC cohort, the majority of cases (78 cases; 88.6%) harbored TFE3 fusions, while the remainder harbored TFEB (8 cases; 9.1%) or MITF (2 cases; 2.3%) fusions.  Four different TFEB fusion partners were observed including CADM2, CLTC, COL21A1 and MALAT1. TFEB and MITF fusion partners tended to preserve less of the N-terminal fusion partner in the fusion product compared to TFE3. The authors conclude that most tRCCs harbor few somatic alterations apart from MiT/TFE fusions."
