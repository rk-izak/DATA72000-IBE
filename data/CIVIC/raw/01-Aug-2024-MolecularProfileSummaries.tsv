ABL1 BCR::ABL1	1	The BCR-ABL fusion protein, commonly referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome, is one of the most studied fusion genes in cancer. It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.	1	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/1	298.5	232, 259, 260, 261, 220, 213, 344, 4706, 4436, 12047, 12046, 12048, 7838	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/232, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/259, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/260, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/261, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/220, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/213, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/344, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4706, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4436, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12047, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12046, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12048, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7838			BCR-ABL, BCR-ABL1, T(9;22)(Q34;Q11)	2024-07-08 00:13:50 UTC	false
AKT1 E17K	4	AKT1 E17K is a recurrent mutation that has been observed in breast, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancer. It has been convincingly shown to be an activating mutation resulting in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity. It has been suggested that this mutation decreases the cell's sensitivity to AKT1 allosteric kinase inhibitors. This, and other AKT1 mutations, are the subject of much research and development for therapeutics.	4	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/4	33.5	4029, 707, 709, 3039, 231	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4029, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/707, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/709, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3039, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/231			GLU17LYS, RS34409589	2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false
ALK EML4::ALK	5	The EML4-ALK fusion variant 1 consisting of ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) fused to EML4 exons 1-13 is the most common EML4-ALK variant, and was discovered in non-small cell lung cancer. Multiple EML4 breakpoint shave been described with differential sensitivity to inhibitors with variant 1 showing greater sensitivity than 3a in cell lines. EML4-ALK is crizotinib sensitive; however, several mutations that confer resistance mutations have been described in case studies. In the only clinical trial for crizotinib that included determination of EML4-ALK variant type in a subset of its participants, a very high response rate was observed, although the numbers were insufficient to validate correlation of variant type to outcome. Preclinical studies with this variant have indicated sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors.	5	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/5	48.0	1207, 1206, 262, 1332, 9228, 1203, 1188, 1121	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1207, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1206, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/262, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1332, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9228, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1203, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1188, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1121			EML4-ALK	2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false

BRAF V600E	12	BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.	12	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/12	1378.5	1421, 11672, 99, 8507, 2362, 1749, 3757,

CCNE1 Overexpression	24	Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as its counterpart, cyclin D, has been implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, are correlated with later stage disease and have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma. It has also been shown, in lung cancer specifically, that neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their lowly expressed counterparts.	24	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/24	42.0	363, 365, 1734	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/363, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/365, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1734				2024-05-31 16:30:19 UTC	false
CDK4 EXPRESSION	25	CDK4, along with its partner CDK6, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.	25	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/25	10.0	4872, 7798, 264	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4872, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7798, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/264				2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false
CDKN2A Promoter Hypermethylation	27	CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the CDKN2A promoter region. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcomes for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.	27	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/27	30.0	367, 368	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/367, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/368				2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false
CEBPA N-TERMINAL FRAME SHIFT	28	CEBPA N-terminal frame shift mutations that result in a premature stop codon are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis; however, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications. N-terminal frame shift mutations within amino acids 1-120 have been shown to disrupt expression of the full-length 42kDa isoform while maintaining expression of a 30kDa isoform (translated from the AUG at full-length protein isoform amino acid M120). This 30kDa isoform exhibits dominant negative activity.	28	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/28	18.0	1103, 169	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1103, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/169				2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false

DNMT3A R882	32	DNMT3A R882 mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) with R882H as the most common form. Mutations in DNMT3A have largely been associated with poorer prognosis, however this is not consistent across all studies. This may be a result of patient age or combining R882 and non-R882 mutations during analysis as studies have indicated independent mechanisms of action and differential prognostic implications for these mutation types. One study that independently analyzed R882 and non-R882 mutations showed R882 mutations were associated with poorer prognosis than patients with wildtype and non-R882 mutations, but only in older patients with AML.	32	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/32	510.0	113, 187, 112, 24, 25, 3, 64, 51, 49, 62, 65, 66, 68, 67, 63, 61, 115, 114, 110, 170, 157, 186, 4, 18, 50, 31, 11, 189	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/113, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/187, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/112, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/24, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/25, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/64, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/51, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/49, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/62, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/65, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/66, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/68, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/67, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/63, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/61, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/115, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/114, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/110, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/170, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/157, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/186, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/18, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/50, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/31, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/189			ARG693, ARG882, R693	2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false
EGFR L858R	33	EGFR L858R has long been recognized as a functionally significant mutation in cancer, and is one of the most prevalent single mutations in lung cancer. Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.	33	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/33	379.0	4291, 2629, 2626, 2632, 2624, 275, 4295, 4285, 4292, 4860, 2628, 5922, 276, 4287, 2631, 347, 968, 1665, 2634, 3811, 4265, 4290, 2997, 2621, 229, 2627, 2994, 982, 885, 883, 879, 4288, 4284, 4294, 6183, 4286, 4293	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4291, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2629, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2626, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2632, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2624, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/275, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4295, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4285, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4292, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4860, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2628, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5922, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/276, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4287, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2631, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/347, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/968, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1665, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2634, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3811, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4265, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4290, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2997, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2621, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/229, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2627, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2994, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/982, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/885, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/883, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/879, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4288, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4284, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4294, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6183, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4286, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4293	5, 6, 105	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/5, https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/6, https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/105	LEU858ARG, RS121434568	2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false
EGFR T790M	34	EGFR T790M was one of the very first mutations recognized to confer resistance to targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer. While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.	34	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/34	406.25	2158, 1667, 2157, 369, 966, 963, 1391, 642, 1863, 1867, 2160, 2162, 2163, 3810, 277, 965, 6006, 2159, 2161, 240, 238, 2164, 646, 370, 1397, 762, 967, 1592, 2165, 278, 239	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2158, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1667, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2157, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/369, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/966, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/963, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1391, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/642, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1863, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1867, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2160, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2162, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2163, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3810, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/277, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/965, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6006, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2159, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2161, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/240, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/238, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2164, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/646, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/370, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1397, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/762, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/967, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1592, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2165, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/278, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/239	130	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/130	RS121434569, THR790MET	2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false

FLT3 ITD	55	FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.	55	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/55	448.5	1112, 7382, 128, 158, 159, 127, 190, 193, 371, 372, 52, 69, 192, 191, 1555, 297, 298, 299, 7369, 198, 1109, 1515, 130, 131, 222, 129, 1137, 8923, 8924, 195, 1040	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1112, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7382, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/128, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/158, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/159, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/127, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/190, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/193, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/371, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/372, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/52, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/69, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/192, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/191, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1555, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/297, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/298, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/299, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7369, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/198, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1109, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1515, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/130, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/131, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/222, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/129, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1137, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8923, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8924, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/195, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1040	38	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/38		2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false

NPM1 EXON 12 MUTATION	86	NPM1 exon 12 mutations are frequently identified in patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and often co-occur with FLT3-ITD. FLT3 status should also be evaluated as co-occurence with FLT3-ITD may impact prognosis. Exon 12 mutations have been identified as a predictor of good prognostic outcomes in the absence of FLT3-ITD. Due to their high frequency, NPM1 mutations have been retrospectively analyzed in the context of a number of therapies including variable results following ATRA treatment as well as improved response to high-dose daunorubicin or valproic acid. Additionally, multiple groups have shown increased surface expression of CD33 associated with NPM1 mutation, suggesting these patients may respond to anti-CD33 therapy.

DNMT3A Mutation	189	DNMT3A mutations occur in a variety of myeloid malignancies. These mutations are associated with adverse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in the context of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations, which often co-occur. Early results indicate AML patients with DNMT3A mutations may respond better to decitabine than those with wild-type. Shorter survival has been indicated in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, however, larger cohorts are required to verify this finding. DNMT3A mutations have been suggested as a pre-leukemic lesion and found in older individuals with clonal hematopoiesis but no overt malignancy.	189	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/189	115.0	1238, 2926, 1586, 1585, 188, 1587, 469	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1238, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2926, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1586, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1585, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/188, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1587, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/469				2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false

IDH2 R172	199	IDH2 R172 is a gain-of-function mutation commonly observed in acute myeloid leukemia and is enriched in those patients which are cytogenetically normal. R172 is analogous to IDH1 R132 mutations and leads to neomorphic enzymatic activity. Specifically this mutation "catalyzes the conversion of alpha ketoglurarate to beta-hydrozyglutarate" leading to increased levels of beta-hydrozyglutarate. This in turn leads to hypermethylation of target genes and an inhibition of cellular differentiation. R172 mutations generally lead to worse overall survival and higher rates of relapse compared to the most common IDH2 mutations in AML (R140).	199	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/199	105.0	1511, 482, 627, 483, 628	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1511, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/482, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/627, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/483, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/628			ARG172	2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false
IKZF1 Deletion	200	IKZF1 deletions have been reported in a variety of cancer types including pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL), Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, T-cell ALL as well as solid tumors of the large intestine, lung, and liver. The clinical impact of these deletions is unknown for many cancer types however a poor outcome has been observed in leukemia based disease. This gene has been strongly implicated as a regulator for "normal hematopoiesis". In regards to BCP ALL, mouse models have shown that mutations in IKZF1 are not sufficient in and of themselves to cause disease. Haploinsuffeciency in combination with BCR-ABL1 however, will accelerate leukemiagenesis possibly indicating that at least in regards to BCP ALL these are secondary events that may be necessary for the development of leukaemic clones.	200	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/200	240.0	7366, 626, 484, 7404, 625, 624, 7365, 629, 7541, 7532	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7366, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/626, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/484, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7404, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/625, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/624, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7365, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/629, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7541, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7532	28	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/28		2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false

TERT Promoter Mutation	220	TERT promoter mutations are activating and commonly found at two hotspots within the TERT promoter region which occur 124 and 146 base pairs (hg19) upstream of the translation start site. These hotspots, termed C228T and C250T are observed in many cancer types and have a particularly high prevalence in glioblastoma (83%), melanoma (71%), bladder cancer (66%) and hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) (47%). The two mutations are usually heterozygous and mutually exclusive and result in an increased similarity to an ETS binding domain and may act as a binding site to an ETS transcription factor. These mutations are thought to be early events in tumorgenesis and aid in cellular immortality. Decreased overall survival in patients with these mutations have been observed in medulloblastoma, thyroid cancer, urogenital cancer, melanoma, and laryngeal tumors. The presence of these mutations has also been shown to be predictive of malignant/premalignant nodules in HCC and meningiomas.	220	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/220	105.0	515, 516, 658, 976, 657, 6933, 7188	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/515, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/516, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/658, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/976, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/657, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6933, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7188			-146C>T, -124C>T	2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false

One study reports FGFR1 aberrations in 3.5% of 4,853 patients of which most are FGFR1 amplifications (Helsten et. al., 2016). Preclinically, FGFR1 amplifications have also been shown to confer sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitors (Weiss et. al., 2010). Clinical studies are currently ongoing (e.g. NCT01004224).	267	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/267	185.5	683, 1105, 1767, 687, 685, 684, 7488, 682, 680, 1991, 7246, 686, 1911, 1247, 3027, 1604, 7811, 1909, 1908	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/683, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1105, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1767, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/687, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/685, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/684, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7488, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/682, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/680, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1991, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7246, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/686, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1911, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1247, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3027, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1604, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7811, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1909, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1908				2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false
FGFR1 Expression	264	FGFR1 high expression has been reported in 11.8% (178 patients) of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, and was enriched in early stages (Freier et. al., 2007). Another study reports FGFR1 expression in 35% of primary HNSSC (353 patients) (Göke et. al., 2015). In both studies, FGFR1 gene amplification and expression do not correlate well with about 35% of samples with FGFR1 amplification overexpressing FGFR1 (Göke et. al., 2015). FGFR1 expression also correlated with sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitors in preclinical models of lung cancer (Wynes et. al., 2014), HNSSC (Göke et. al., 2015) and urothelial carcinoma (Lamont et. al., 2011).	268	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/268	46.0	793, 801, 970, 681, 799, 896, 800, 2915, 798	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/793, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/801, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/970, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/681, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/799, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/896, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/800, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2915, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/798				2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false
ROS1 Rearrangement	265	ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that frequently forms gene fusions in several cancer types. Approximately 2% of NSCLC patients harbor a ROS1 gene fusion. Several fusion partners have been described with a constant ROS1-breakpoint, maintaining the kinase domain (Solomon B, 2015). Following case-studies and retrospective analyses, an expansion cohort of a phase-1 study showed clinical benefit of crizotinib in ROS1 rearranged NSCLC. The benefit was independent of the type of ROS1-rearrangement (Shaw et. al.,2014).	269	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/269	108.0	1030, 7933, 1248, 1443, 1690, 1301, 688, 2951	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1030, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7933, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1248, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1443, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1690, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1301, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/688, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2951				2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false

CDKN2A p16 Expression	268	CDKN2A (p16) expression is a surrogate marker of HPV infection in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. CDKN2A and p53 are inactivated through HPV proteins E6 and E7 and therefore not altered in expression level in HPV-associated carcinomas. However, there is no perfect overlap between p16 expression and HPV status with some 10-12.5% of HPV-negative tumors expressing p16. (Seiwert, T JCO, 2014). p16 positivity is a well-established positive prognostic factor in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in the primary and, as increasing evidence suggests, recurrent/metastatic disease settings. Predictive information from HPV status have not been established to date. A lack of benefit from EGFR-inhibitors has been proposed by some studies. Other studies were not able to reproduce this finding.	272	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/272	180.0	697, 758, 1155, 759, 1314, 696, 695, 753, 804, 694	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/697, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/758, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1155, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/759, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1314, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/696, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/695, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/753, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/804, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/694				2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false

ERBB2 Amplification	302	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.	306	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/306	891.0	1693, 7638, 761, 760, 1006, 886, 895, 962, 1009, 1613, 1022, 1561, 1077, 1432, 1891, 9778, 11668, 1011, 1013, 1159, 1133, 1007, 1382, 1439, 529, 528, 5986, 1993, 5985, 5982, 5984, 1688, 1689, 1687, 1686, 1050, 1499, 887, 961, 1381, 1437, 1132, 7807, 1096, 1448, 1098, 1380, 1042, 1764, 1044, 1097, 5983, 5981, 1008, 1160, 1012, 7647, 1113, 2071, 1122, 1393, 1023, 1041, 11249, 7302	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1693, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7638, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/761, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/760, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1006, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/886, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/895, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/962, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1009, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1613, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1022, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1561, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1077, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1432, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1891, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9778, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11668, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1011, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1013, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1159, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1133, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1007, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1382, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1439, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/529, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/528, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5986, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1993, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5985, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5982, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5984, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1688, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1689, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1687, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1686, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1050, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1499, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/887, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/961, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1381, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1437, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1132, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7807, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1096, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1448, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1098, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1380, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1042, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1764, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1044, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1097, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5983, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5981, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1008, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1160, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1012, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7647, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1113, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2071, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1122, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1393, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1023, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1041, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11249, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7302	32, 1, 2	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/32, https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/1, https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/2	OVEREXPRESSION	2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false

PIK3CA Mutation	307	PIK3CA mutations are observed in many cancers among the most prevalent are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. These mutations have been observed in up to 40%, 20%, and 21% respectively for each of these cancer types with mutations commonly occurring within the helical exon 9 and kinase domain of exon 20. In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC. Interestingly PIK3CA mutations in HNSCC have been observed to be absent from a number of ethnic groups including greek, german, and vietnamese populations.	311	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/311	446.5	1616, 1504, 6188, 1364, 6362, 892, 6297, 6300, 6299, 915, 2098, 1501, 1358, 1490, 6189, 771, 1503, 1360, 1402, 1705, 1607, 1384, 1610, 3040, 1600, 2087, 2025, 8705, 1296, 6301, 6375, 6298, 2355, 8536, 3732, 7313, 7185, 2105, 11678, 11679	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1616, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1504, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6188, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1364, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6362, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/892, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6297, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6300, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6299, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/915, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2098, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1501, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1358, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1490, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6189, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/771, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1503, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1360, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1402, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1705, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1607, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1384, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1610, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3040, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1600, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2087, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2025, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8705, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1296, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6301, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6375, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6298, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2355, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8536, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3732, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7313, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7185, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2105, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11678, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11679	22	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/22		2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false
EGFR VIII	308	The EGFRvIII variant is an oncogenic mutation that has been reported in several cancers including glioblastoma multiforme, breast, lung, head and neck, ovarian and prostate. In high-grade gliomas, EGFRvIII has been reported in about 30% of cases with EGFR amplification. The EGFRvIII mutation leads to deletion of the receptor ectodomain exons 2-7. The presence of this variant has been linked with clinical response to EGFR TKI.

MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutation	320	Exon 14 mutations have been observed in ~3% of patients with NSCLC (28/933 reported by Awad et al J Clin Onc 2016), confirmed to cause exon skipping when available, and associated with concurrent MET amplification. Responses to the c-MET inhibitor crizotinib have been reported in preclinical models and in individual case reports as well as a small-scale clinical trial (17 patients treated, Drilon et al., 2016 (suppl; abstr 108; ASCO ID 167889-176)). Larger studies are needed but enrollment of patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutation in trials with MET inhibitors or off-label treatment is encouraged (Paik et al., 2015 (suppl; abstr 8021)).	324	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/324	108.5	7272, 797, 1186, 736, 1651, 7643, 7796, 8847, 7797, 7642, 4786, 1185	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7272, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/797, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1186, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/736, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1651, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7643, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7796, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8847, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7797, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7642, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4786, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1185	112	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/112		2024-04-16 22:42:41 UTC	false

ERBB2 Y772_A775DUP	410	Mutations in the HER2 kinase domain occur at a 2-4% frequency in lung adenocarcinomas, the majority of which are in exon 20 as in-frame duplications or insertions in a small 8 codon region (774-781 or 775-782). These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.	414	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/414	42.0	1045, 960, 1047, 1125, 1893, 1888	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1045, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/960, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1047, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1125, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1893, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1888			A775_G776INSYVMA, TYR772_ALA775DUP, P.E770_A771INSAYVM, A775INSYVMA, P.A775_G776INSYVMA, M774INSAYVM	2024-04-16 22:42:42 UTC	false

IDH1 R132H	416	IDH1 R132 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.	420	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/420	9.0	5987, 979	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5987, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/979			ARG132HIS, RS121913500	2024-04-16 22:42:42 UTC	false

CBFB CBFB::MYH11	427	CBFB-MYH11 is the result of inv(16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13;q22) and is sufficient for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (in the correct setting) according to WHO criteria, even when blast counts are <20% (Vardiman et al, Blood 2008). This fusion is typically associated with favorable prognosis relative to other AML subtypes (including cytogenetically normal); however, the impact of additional mutations in the context of this fusion is incompletely understood. AMLs with this fusion are often grouped with other rearrangements affecting genes encoding core binding factor subunits, referred to as CBF AMLs.	431	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/431	35.0	11793, 1027	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11793, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1027			CBFB-MYH11, INV(16)(P13.1;Q22), T(16;16)(P13.1;Q22)	2024-04-16 22:42:42 UTC	false

ERBB2 S310F/Y	493	ERBB2 S310F/Y was one of the first ERBB2 variants to be functionally classified (Greulich et al. 2012). This mutation was shown to be an activating mutation (through hyperphosphorylation) in an in vitro assay. In the same paper, this mutation (along with other ERBB2 activating mutations) in murine Ba/F3 cells have been shown to be sensitive to the ERBB2 inhibitors (afatinib, lapatinib and neratinib). More recent evidence may show that HER2 acitivating mutations confer sensitivity to a host of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which is the topic of current clinical trials and research.	497	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/497	4.0	1179	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1179				2024-04-16 22:42:42 UTC	false

ALK Fusion	495	Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.	499	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/499	798.0	1419, 1577, 4858, 2952, 7362, 945, 1272, 1201, 1273, 1335, 1175, 1783, 1240, 1264, 1202, 1334, 6042, 1243, 11122, 7361, 12012, 1200, 8657, 7285, 7286, 1199, 6043, 1198, 11218, 1691, 7284, 1279, 4835, 1282, 1187, 5954, 11121	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1419, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1577, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4858, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2952, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7362, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/945, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1272, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1201, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1273, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1335, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1175, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1783, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1240, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1264, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1202, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1334, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6042, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1243, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11122, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7361, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/12012, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1200, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8657, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7285, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7286, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1199, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6043, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1198, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11218, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1691, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7284, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1279, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4835, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1282, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1187, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5954, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11121	66, 67, 65, 3, 34	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/66, https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/67, https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/65, https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/3, https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/34	REARRANGEMENT	2024-04-16 22:42:42 UTC	false
ALK EML4::ALK e20-e20	496	EML4-ALK variant 2 consists of a fusion of the ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) with EML4 exons 1-20. Variant 2 has cytoplasmic distribution and makes up ~10% of EML4-ALK fusions found in NSCLC,. Although the specific variant is not consistently reported, single cases demonstrating response to crizotinib treatment in NSCLC and a differentiated malignant neoplasm of unknown origin have been reported. In vitro, this variant has shown greater sensitivity to ALK inhibition with TAE684 and crizotinib than the EML4-ALK variants 1 (E13;A20), 3a (E6;A20) and 3b (E6ins33;A20). The variant was reported to be less stable in cells than other variants, and may be a client protein of Hsp90. Along these lines the variant has shown preclinical sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition.	500	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/500	16.5	1196, 1189, 1204	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1196, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1189, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1204			EML4-ALK E20-E20	2024-04-16 22:42:42 UTC	false

ALK EML4::ALK e6-e20	499	The EML4-ALK variant 3a consists of the ALK kinase domain fused to EML4 exons 1-6, while the 3b variant has an additional 33bp of intronic EML4 sequence between EML4 and ALK regions. The two variants were found to originate from a single genomic rearrangement, and 3a/3b is found in ~ 30% of EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. Variant 3a has cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. In vitro, these variants have shown sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib but less sensitive than other EML4-ALK variants. The H2228 cell line contains 3a and 3b variants and is described as having cyctostatic response to ALK inhibition as opposed to apoptotic. In a study of 31 NSCLC patients with EML4-ALK rearrangements, 4/5 patients with the 3a variant showed a partial response while 1 showed progressive disease (the only PD observed). In cells the 3a variant was reported to be more stable than other variants, less sensitive to crizotinib and not to respond to Hsp90 inhibition.	503	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/503	25.0	1192, 1195, 1245, 1194, 1340, 1193, 1205, 1197	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1192, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1195, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1245, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1194, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1340, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1193, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1205, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1197			EML4-ALK E6-E20	2024-04-16 22:42:42 UTC	false

KIT Exon 9 Mutation	505	In patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), imatinib has improved outcomes for patients with KIT mutations. However, acquired resistance to imatinib is common. Patients harboring exon 9 KIT mutations may benefit from higher imatinib doses (800mg/daily). Similarly, imatinib-refractory tumors showed sensitivity to sunitinib treatment. Improved responses to either treatment were not observed in patients with exon 11 mutations.	509	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/509	122.5	2466, 4104, 1223, 4139, 1424, 4628, 1221, 2477	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2466, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4104, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1223, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4139, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1424, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4628, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1221, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2477				2024-04-16 22:42:42 UTC	false

GLI1 ACTB::GLI1	761	Fusion of the hedgehog pathway component gene GLI1 to the β-actin gene (ACTB) has been described as a mechanism of GLI1,and by extension hedgehog pathway, activation. These fusions have been described in histologically distinctive soft tissue tumours showing a pericytic phenotype. Gene fusions retain the DNA-binding zinc finger domains of GLI1 and it is likely that the replacement of the promoter region of GLI1with that of the ubiquitously expressed ACTB gene leads to deregulation of GLI expression and its downstream target genes.	780	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/780	15.0	1844	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1844			ACTB-GLI1, T(7;12)(P21-22;Q13-15)	2024-04-16 22:42:42 UTC	false

ALK Alternative Transcript (ATI)	813	A novel ALK transcript (alternative isoform) that initiates from a de novo alternative transcription initiation (ATI) site in ALK intron 19 produces three protein products with slight variation in size and all containing the tyrosine kinase domain. ALK(ATI) products have been shown to stimulate oncogenic pathways and promote tumourigenesis in vivo. ALK(ATI) expression was found in 11% of melanomas examined and rarely in other cancer types.	839	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/839	20.0	7421, 1936	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7421, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1936			ALK INTRON 19 ATI ISOFORM, ALK(ATI), ALK ALTERNATIVE ISOFORM	2024-04-16 22:42:42 UTC	false

RET C609Y	1234	There is some functional evidence that this variant leads to reduced RET activity (PMID: 9230192) and increased cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis (PMID: 16715139). It has been widely reported in both familial and sporadic cases of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 with medullary thyroid cancers. Despite extensive WGS and Exome coverage for a combined total of ~150k alleles in the GNOMAD browser, this variant has never been observed.	1260	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/1260	20.0	2913	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2913			CYS609TYR	2024-04-16 22:42:43 UTC	false

TP53 CONSERVED DOMAIN MUT	1274	This conserved domain mutation variant covers mutations in regions of p53 reported to be highly conserved during evolution. These regions span codons 117-143 (region II), 171-181 (region III), 234-258 (region (IV), and 270-286 (region V). Region I covers approximately codons 10 through 25 but does not appear in all studies on conserved domain mutations. There is overlap with these regions and reported regions of hotspot p53 mutations, where it is observed that hotspots for detrimental mutation correspond to more highly evolutionary conserved regions. While there is agreement and overlap between different reports, the literature does not seem to indicate an exact consensus on these regions of human p53 at this time, but the four highly conserved regions are part of the DNA binding domain, and are reported to exist within codons 97 to 292.	1300	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/1300	15.0	2993	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2993				2024-04-16 22:42:43 UTC	false

VHL R167Q (c.500G>A)	1615	R167Q is the most common point mutation in hereditary Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and disrupts the VHL genes binding to elongin C reducing the levels of the VHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) E3 ligase complex and inhibiting the ability of VHL to regulate HIF2α. This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.	1739	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/1739	110.0	6587, 5402, 5381, 9538, 6619, 5469, 5487, 5485, 5354, 5264, 6520, 5546, 8992, 6222, 5062, 4913	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6587, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5402, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5381, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9538, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6619, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5469, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5487, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5485, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5354, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5264, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6520, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5546, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8992, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6222, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5062, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/4913	4	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/4	RS5030821, ARG167GLN, C.500G>A	2024-04-16 22:42:44 UTC	false

VHL E70K (c.208G>A)	1832	The VHL gene has a low rate of benign missense variation and is known to be definitively associated with VHL disease. The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.	1956	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/1956	37.5	6503, 6742, 5780, 6860, 5805, 5273	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6503, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6742, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5780, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6860, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5805, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/5273	14	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/14	C.208G>A, GLU70LYS, RS5030802	2024-04-16 22:42:45 UTC	false

ABL1 NUP214::ABL1	2529	The NUP214 -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the NUP214 (Nucleoporin 214) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 34 of NUP214 to exon 2 of ABL1 (NUP214-ABL1 34-2). In T-ALL, the fusion is typically expressed from amplified extrachromosomal bodies (episomes) that arise when the genomic region from ABL1 to NUP214 circularizes to generate the NUP214-ABL1 fusion. In B-ALL, the fusion commonly results from an intrachromosomal duplication involving chromosome 9, with breakpoints within the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. The fusion has been identified in 6% of cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and rare cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, single nucleotide polymorphism array, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ABL1 gene. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the WD40 repeat and coiled-coil domains of NUP214 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The case report that illustrates the clinical significance of the NUP214-ABL1 fusion describes a 6-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with normal karyotype. Both patients demonstrated minimal residual disease after induction chemotherapy, and later experienced relapse after either consolidation therapy or bone marrow transplant. Dasatinib was then prescribed and follow-up information is available for the older child, who successfully achieved a complete response for three months before succumbing to the disease. The clinical details of this case could predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).	2660	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2660	27.0	7208, 9074, 9150, 9148	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7208, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9074, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9150, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9148			NUP214-ABL1	2024-04-16 22:42:46 UTC	false

ABL1 SNX2::ABL1	2547	The SNX2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SNX2 (Sorting Nexin 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).	2678	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2678	30.5	7744, 7655, 9177, 9178, 7694, 7254, 7241	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7744, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7655, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9177, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9178, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7694, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7254, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7241	43	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/43	SNX2-ABL1	2024-04-16 22:42:46 UTC	false
ABL1 RCSD1::ABL1	2550	The RCSD1-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the RCSD1 (RCS Domain Containing 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 2 or, more frequently, exon 3 of RCSD1 to exon 4 of ABL1 (RCSD1-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(q24.2;q34.12) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype, RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the ABL1 SH2, actin binding domain, and tyrosine kinase domain, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The RCSD1-ABL1 fusion has been documented in greater than fifteen pediatric and adult patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. The majority that that were exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs: imatinib, dasatinib, or ponatinib) experienced durable remissions until the TKIs were discontinued. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with TKIs and are the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).	2681	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2681	80.5	9213, 7783, 7249, 9164, 9166, 7248, 9165, 9075, 9167, 9162, 9163, 9168, 9169	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9213, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7783, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7249, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9164, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9166, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7248, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9165, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9075, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9167, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9162, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9163, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9168, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9169			RCSD1-ABL1	2024-04-16 22:42:46 UTC	false
ABL1 FOXP1::ABL1	2551	The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the FOXP1 (Forkhead box P1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 27 of FOXP1to exon 4 of ABL1 (FOXP1-ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(3;9)(p12;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and NGS. FOXP1 is critical for the transcriptional regulatory network of B lymphopoiesis; it may also act as a tumor suppressor gene. Absence or deficiency of FOXP1 during early B-cell development may block pro-B cell to pre-B cell development. The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion protein leads to activated tyrosine kinase and may further alter the critical cellular function of these 2 genes. Clinical significance: The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion has been documented in 3 young adult patients (2 male, 1 female) with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. One patient had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib) added to the chemotherapy regimens, who had bone marrow tested negative for MRD at end of consolidation. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Functional studies are needed to substantiate the efficacy of TKI treatment of this particular ABL-class fusion.	2682	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2682	10.0	7651, 7292, 7253	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7651, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7292, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7253			FOXP1-ABL1	2024-04-16 22:42:46 UTC	false

JAK2 ATF7IP::JAK2	2715	The ATF7IP-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the ATF7IP (Activating Transcription Factor 7 Interacting Protein) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and a part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. Known breakpoint/splice variants join exon 10 of ATF7IP to exon 8 of JAK2 (ATF7IP-JAK2 10-8), exon 13 of ATF7IP to exon 16 of JAK2 (ATF7IP-JAK2 13-16), or exon 13 of ATF7IP to exon 17 of JAK2 (ATF7IP-JAK2 13-17). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;12) (p24;p13.1), and has been identified by RNA sequencing and Sanger sequencing in three adult patients with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil and MDN1 domains from ATF7IP and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. The coiled coil domain is hypothesized to constitutively activate the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby upregulating the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Clinical significance: The novel ATF7IP-JAK2 fusion has been documented in three cases for which specific clinical information is unavailable. A pre-clinical xenograft model containing the fusion was sensitive to exposure to the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib. Therefore, the presence of the JAK2 JH1 kinase domain in the fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to the treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).	2846	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2846	15.0	7671, 8095	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7671, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8095			ATF7IP-JAK2	2024-04-16 22:42:47 UTC	false
JAK2 EBF1::JAK2	2716	The EBF1-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the EBF1 (Early B-Cell Factor Transcription Factor 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 14 of EBF1 to exon 17 of JAK2 (EBF1-JAK2 14-17). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(5;9) (q33.3;p24), and has been identified by RNA sequencing in one adolescent patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the DNA binding, immunoglobulin-life fold, and helix-loop-helix domains from EBF1 and an intact JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, as confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the EBF1-JAK2 fusion protein has not been performed. Clinical significance: The novel EBF1-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one case for which specific clinical information is unavailable. However, the presence of the JAK2 JH1 kinase domain in the fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition.

JAK2 STRN3::JAK2	2718	The STRN3-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the STRN3 (Striatin 3) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and a part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. The published breakpoint joins exon 9 of STRN3 to exon 17 of JAK2 (STRN3 -JAK2 9-17). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;14) (p24;q12), and has been identified by RNA sequencing in one pediatric patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the Striatin domain from STRN3 and the JH2 pseudokinase domain and intact JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, as confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the STRN3-JAK2 fusion protein has not been performed. Clinical significance: The novel STRN3-JAK2 fusion has been documented in a single case for which specific clinical information is unavailable. However, the presence of the JAK2 JH1 kinase domain in the fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition.

JAK2 TPR::JAK2	2719	The TPR-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the TPR (Translocated Promoter Region, Nuclear Basket Protein) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and a part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. The published breakpoint joins exon 39 of TPR to exon 17 of JAK2 (TPR -JAK2 39-17). The fusion stems from a reciprocal translocation t(1;9) (q31.1;p24), and has been identified by FISH and RNA sequencing in one young adult patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the TPR/MLP1/MLP2-like protein domain from TERF2 and the JH2 pseudokinase domain and intact JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, as confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the TPR-JAK2 fusion protein has not been performed. Clinical significance: The novel TPR-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one case for which specific clinical information is unavailable. However, the presence of the JAK2 JH1 kinase domain in the fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition.

JAK2 ETV6::JAK2	2728	The ETV6-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the ETV6 (ETS Variant Transcription Factor 6) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. Known breakpoint/splice variants join exon 4 of ETV6 to exon 17 of JAK2 (ETV6-JAK2 4-17), exon 5 of ETV6 to exon 12 of JAK2 (ETV6-JAK2 5-12), or exon 5 of ETV6 to exon 19 of JAK2 (ETV6-JAK2 5-19). The fusion results from the reciprocal translocation t(9;12)(p24;p13), cytogenetically cryptic, and has been identified by FISH and RNA sequencing. The fusion gene is expressed from the der(9) chromosome. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the PNT domain from ETV6 and JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. The ETV6 PNT domain is hypothesized to result in dimerization, which leads to aberrant JAK2 kinase domain activation. Depending on the breakpoint variant, the fusion protein may also contain the JAK2 JH2 pseudokinase domain. The inclusion of the JH1 domain may affect functional effects and disease specificity of the abnormal fusion. Functionally, the fusion results in aberrant activation of JAK2 kinase, leading to activation of downstream signaling through the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The ETV6-JAK2 fusion is associated with hematologic malignancies and has been observed in B-lymphoblastic leukemia (~10%), T-lymphoblastic leukemia (isolated cases), and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and gene rearrangements (rare cases). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion in B-lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion has been associated with high-risk disease. As a predictive marker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion has been shown by limited pre-clinical data and case reports to predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to treatment of pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).	2859	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2859	25.0	7696, 8102, 8097	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7696, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8102, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8097			ETV6-JAK2	2024-04-16 22:42:47 UTC	false
JAK2 BCR::JAK2	2729	The BCR-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the BCR (Breakpoint Cluster Region) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. Known breakpoint/splice variants join exon 14 of BCR to exon 17 of JAK2 (BCR-JAK2 4-17) and exon 1 of BCR to exons 15 (BCR-JAK2 1-15), 17 (BCR-JAK2 1-17), or 19 (BCR-JAK2 1-19). The fusion results from the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(p24;p11.2), and has been identified by karyotype analysis, FISH, RT-PCR, targeted ligation amplification (TLA), and RNA sequencing. The fusion gene is expressed from the der(9) chromosome. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil domain from BCR and the JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. Depending on the breakpoint variant, the fusion protein may also contain the JAK2 JH2 pseudokinase domain. In pre-clinical studies, the coiled coil domain of BCR has been shown to mediate oligomeric activation of the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby promoting downstream signaling by signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The BCR-JAK2 fusion is associated with hematologic malignancies and has been observed in myeloproliferative neoplasms with eosinophilia (multiple cases), B-lymphoblastic leukemia (multiple cases), acute myeloid leukemia (a rare case), and B-cell lymphoma (rare case of Burkitt lymphoma). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker in B-lymphoblastic leukemia, the BCR-JAK2 fusion is frequently observed in the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the fusion appears to be associated with high-risk disease in pediatric and adult populations. As a predictive marker, patients whose diseases exhibit the BCR-JAK2 fusion have experienced partial responses or even complete remission with hydroxyurea and/or interferon alfa. Case reports have demonstrated the limited utility of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. One patient diagnosed with a myeloid neoplasm initially responded to the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, but relapsed after 18 months. Current research has suggested a survival advantage following allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation.	2860	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2860	35.0	8096, 8101, 7697, 7698	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8096, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8101, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7697, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7698			BCR-JAK2	2024-04-16 22:42:47 UTC	false
JAK2 PAX5::JAK2	2730	The PAX5-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the PAX5 (Paired Box 5) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 5 of PAX5 to exon 19 of JAK2 (PAX5-JAK2 5-19). The fusion is hypothesized to result from an intrachromosomal translocation, inversion, or deletion of chromosome 9 (involving loci p13 and p24), and has been identified by RNA sequencing, RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and FISH in patients B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the DNA-binding paired domain from PAX5 and the JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. A pre-clinical study has revealed that this fusion protein deregulates the PAX5 transcriptional pathway while also autophosphorylating the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby promoting downstream signaling by signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker, the PAX5-JAK2 fusion in B-lymphoblastic leukemia is frequently associated with the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the fusion has been associated with intermediate to high-risk disease. As a predictive marker, the PAX5-JAK2 fusion has been shown in pre-clinical data to predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).	2861	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2861	30.0	8105, 7699, 7700	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8105, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7699, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7700			PAX5-JAK2	2024-04-16 22:42:47 UTC	false

JAK2 OFD1::JAK2	2843	The OFD1-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the OFD1 (Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. OFD1 is a centrosomal protein of primary cilia implicated in Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome type 1, but it has not been previously described in hematologic malignancies. The published breakpoint joins exon 22 of OFD1 to exon 13 of JAK2 (OFD1-JAK2 22-13). This fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(X;9)(p22;p24), and has been identified in two patients by RNA sequencing, one of which demonstrated the abnormal karyotype 46,XY,-17+mar[11]/46,XY[9]. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the FERM and SH2 domains from OFD1 and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the OFD1-JAK2 fusion protein is reportedly underway. Clinical significance: The novel OFD1-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one 3-year-old and one 11-year-old boy with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. Both children successfully maintained first complete remission following induction chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with as long as 6 years of follow up. While neither patient was treated with a JAK2 inhibitor, the JH1 kinase domain present within the OFD1-JAK2 fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to the treatment of pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).	2974	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2974	10.0	7997, 8104	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7997, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8104			OFD1-JAK2	2024-04-16 22:42:47 UTC	false
JAK2 SMU1::JAK2	2844	The SMU1-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the SMU1 (SMU1 DNA Replication Regulator and Splicesomal Factor) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 18 of SMU1 to exon 12 of JAK2 (SMU1-JAK2 18-12). The fusion is hypothesized to result from an intrachromosomal translocation, inversion, or deletion of chromosome 9 (involving loci p21 and p24), and has been identified by RNA sequencing in an older adult patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the LisH, CTLH, HisP, and Wd40 domains from SMU1 and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. Pre-clinical data demonstrates increased JH1 kinase expression as a result of the SMU1-JAK2 fusion event, which is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Clinical significance: The novel SMU1-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one case for which specific clinical information is unavailable. However, the presence of the JAK2 JH1 kinase domain in the fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to the treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).	2975	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2975	7.5	7996	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7996			SMU1-JAK2	2024-04-16 22:42:47 UTC	false
JAK2 SNX29::JAK2	2845	The SNX29-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the SNX29 (Sorting Nexin 29) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and a part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. The published breakpoint joins exon 18 of SNX29 to exon 13 of JAK2 (SNX29 -JAK2 18-13). It is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;16) (p24;q13.13), and has been identified by RNA sequencing in one normal-karyotype adult patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the RUN and PX_RUN domains from SNX29 and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the SNX29-JAK2 fusion protein has not been performed. Clinical significance: The novel SNX29-JAK2 fusion has been documented in a single case that successfully maintained complete remission without relapse following induction chemotherapy. While the patient was not treated with a JAK2 inhibitor, the JH1 kinase domain present within the SNX29-JAK2 fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to the treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).	2976	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2976	7.5	7998	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7998			SNX29-JAK2	2024-04-16 22:42:47 UTC	false

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 4 of ZNF430 to exon 19 of JAK2 (ZNF430-JAK2 4-19). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;19)(p24;p12), and has been identified by RNA sequencing in one adult patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the KRAB_A-box domain from ZNF430 and the JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs).

JAK2 GOLGA5::JAK2	3083	The GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the GOLGA5 (Golgin A5) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 10 of GOLGA5 to exon 12 of JAK2 (GOLGA5-JAK2 10-12). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;14)(p24;q32), and has been identified in one patient by RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil domain from GOLGA5 and an aberrantly activated JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, which is thought to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The inclusion of the JH1 domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The novel GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one 10-year-old boy with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with complex karyotype. The clinical details of this case could predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. A xenograft model created from the patient's malignant cells demonstrated clearance of the leukemic clone in murine peripheral blood upon exposure to ruxolitinib. Moreover, this drug was added to the child's treatment regimen, resulting in nearly undetectable levels of the GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion measured after 64 days of therapy. The patient has reportedly remained in remission 20 months after CAR T-cell infusion and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This child was included in the currently ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors in treating pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).	3214	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/3214	7.5	7007	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7007			GOLGA5-JAK2	2024-04-16 22:42:47 UTC	false

ABL1 RANBP2::ABL1	3137	The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the RANBP2 (RAN Binding Protein 2) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 18 of RANBP2 to exon 2 of ABL1 (RANBP2-ABL1 18-2). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(2;9)(p12.3;q34.12) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, includes the leucine zipper of RANBP2 and the tyrosine kinase of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in several juvenile and young adult patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further classified as BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Most of the documented patients were treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (specifically dasatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens, but they eventually experienced relapse and succumbed to their disease. The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).	3268	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/3268	10.0	9076, 9211	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9076, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9211			RANBP2-ABL1	2024-04-16 22:42:48 UTC	false
ABL1 ZMIZ1::ABL1	3138	The ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the ZMIZ1 (Zinc Finger MIZ-Type Containing 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The most commonly published breakpoint joins exon 18 of ZMIZ1 to exon 2 of ABL1 (ZMIZ1-ABL1 18-2). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(9;10)(q34.12;q22.3) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype, RT-PCR, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, which contains one of the proline-rich domains of ZMIZ1 and the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain. Similar to other oncogenic fusion proteins, the proline-rich domain of ZMIZ1 is involved in protein-protein interactions, and therefore the fusion may encode a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that upregulates the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Patients harboring the ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion are hypothesized to be eligible for imatinib therapy.	3269	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/3269	32.5	9152, 9149, 9077, 9151	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9152, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9149, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9077, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9151	64	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/64	ZMIZ1-ABL1	2024-04-16 22:42:48 UTC	false

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The CENPC-ABL1 fusion is in-frame and it has been documented in one pediatric patient with high risk BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia.	3270	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/3270	5.0	9078	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9078			CENPC-ABL1	2024-04-16 22:42:48 UTC	false

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein, and the inclusion of the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. The NUP153-ABL1 has been documented in one pediatric patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia, as detected by RNA kinome capture and transcriptome sequencing.	3271	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/3271	5.0	9079	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9079			NUP153-ABL1	2024-04-16 22:42:48 UTC	false
ABL1 LSM14A::ABL1	3141	The LSM14A-ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the LSM14A (LSM14A mRNA processing body assembly factor) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein) and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The fusion is in-frame and it has been documented in two patients with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL). The first patient was a child with high risk Ph-like ALL and the second patient was a 36 years old male who had a poor prednisone response and did not reach complete remission after vincristine-dexamethasone-rituximab or a combination of dasatinib and chemotherapy. The second patient died early of sepsis in a context of uncontrolled disease (survival 2 months).	3272	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/3272	10.0	9080, 9153	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9080, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9153			LSM14A-ABL1	2024-04-16 22:42:48 UTC	false

ABL1 SFPQ::ABL1	3156	The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SFPQ (Splicing factor proline and glutamine rich) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 9 of SFPQ to exon 4 of ABL1 (SFPQ -ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(p34;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The role of the partner gene SFPQ in this fusion remains to be investigated. SFPQ encodes for a protein belonging to a new functionally related group of fusion partners for tyrosine kinases involved in pre-mRNA processing. The presence of 2 coiled-coil domains in the 9 remaining exons of SFPQ could theoretically lead to SFPQ–ABL1 oligomerization, thus leading to constitutive activation of the resulting tyrosine kinase, as reported with other partner genes. Though uncommon, this translocation might be targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Clinical significance: The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion has been documented in six patients (3 male, 3 female) between the ages of 10 and 34 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens, who did not have relapse. One additional patient who did not have tyrosine kinase inhibitor also did not suffer from relapse. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Functional studies are needed to substantiate the efficacy of TKI treatment of this particular ABL-class fusion.	3287	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/3287	32.5	9161, 9362, 9160, 9159, 9158	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9161, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9362, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9160, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9159, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9158			SFPQ-ABL1	2024-04-16 22:42:48 UTC	false

ALK G1202R AND ALK Fusion	4236	ALK fusion with G1202R mutation in the ALK kinase domain was first identified in a lung adenocarcinoma patient who had progressed after 10 months of responding to crizotinib. Further characterization of this variant verified crizotinib resistance and additionally demonstrated resistance to multiple next generation ALK inhibitors including ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib. Experiments using the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG have indicated potential sensitivity of EML4-ALK G1202R to this drug, suggesting this variant may be an HSP90 client protein.	171, 499	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/171, https://civicdb.org/links/variants/499	7.5	1357	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1357			ALK FUSION GLY1202ARG	2024-04-18 16:57:02 UTC	false

ALK EML4::ALK AND ALK T1151dup	4308	The ALK fusion variant with insertion of T at amino acid 1151 was found in an ALK rearranged lung adenocarcinoma which had progressed after responding to crizotinib treatment. The mutation was absent in tumor sample taken before crizotinib treatment. Characterization of the variant using cell lines expressing EML4-ALK with 1151 T insert found the variant to be highly crizotinib resistant, and other work demonstrated resistance to next generation inhibitor alectinib, while resistance to tool compound TAE684 indicates potential resistance to the next generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib which is derived from TAE684. Other experiments suggest theraputic potential for HSP90 inhibitors, as EML4-ALK T1151 Tins sensitivity to 17-AAG has been observed.	5, 4389	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/5, https://civicdb.org/links/variants/4389	18.0	444, 1348, 1347, 1349	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/444, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1348, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1347, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1349				2024-04-16 22:42:50 UTC	false

ROS1 G2032R AND ROS1 CD74::ROS1	5075	The G2032R missense mutation has been observed in patients with crizotinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer harboring CD74-ROS1 rearrangement. Independent in vitro studies have confirmed that this mutation confers marked resistance to crizotinib cells over CD74-ROS1 alone. Multiple groups have indicated CD74-ROS1 G2032R expressing cell lines are sensitive to both cabozantinib and foretinib individually administered in vitro. One group additionally showed this mutation conferred relative resistance to alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, and AZD3463 in vitro.	4908, 1271	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/4908, https://civicdb.org/links/variants/1271	0.0	1101, 1254, 1249, 1100, 1250, 1255	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1101, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1254, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1249, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1100, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1250, https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1255				2024-05-10 22:56:35 UTC	false
